3) In Command Prompt type the following commands to include "munkres" in python:
	->python setup.py build
	->python setup.py install
-------------------------
Execution
Python script that takes "folder name" and value of "alpha" and "beta" from user and
generate required html & Java script file and visualization of graph can be seen using "index.html" generated by this script
"alpha"- The similarity between two sentence of different files should be greater α which is a user specified real number between 0 and 1.
"beta" - There is an edge between two vertices if the similarity between the corresponding document is at least β which is a real number between 0 and 1.
