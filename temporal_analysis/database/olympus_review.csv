I took it on a family trip to Oahu, and it performed very well for what I needed, which was a waterproof camera that was fun, took better pics than my iPhone, could wirelessly shoot photos to my iPad and iPhone, filmed fish underwater, and was easy to use. We didn't need an SLR or premium point and shoot. The underwater setting took amazing video of fish. The above water pics were bright and sharp, particularly in sun/daylight. Sometimes focused slow/incorrectly in low light. Love the different filters, a la Instagram, that you can shoot in--made for some neat pics. After a day in saltwater, I'd shake it in a large bowl of tap water, and then let it sit in the water for a few minutes, then just let dry out. No leaks. Battery life isn't stunning. I didn't bring a spare battery, but it would definitely be useful. Wifi connection between camera and phone or iPad was pretty seamless. Would buy it again in a minute."

Had this camera come out a few years ago it would have been 5 stars but now there are better underwater cameras. The main reason I say that is because there's this odd, pre-focus-pause-event thing that happens when it completes the focus. As a result you'll lose 2'ish seconds waiting for all the pre-taking events to complete. Charging the battery is stupid. You must keep a battery in the camera and run a microUSB cord into the camera to charge it. There's no external charge unit. For all these reasons I just can't justify keeping it. The Olympus 850 was a better camera overall than this."

Previously I had a Nikon Coolpix AW100 that lasted about 3 years until the LCD screen went out. It still snaps pictures, I just can't see them. So I'll be comparing this camera to the Nikon.<br /><br />Recently I used this on our beach vacation. One of the selling points for me was the flip up screen and fast shutter speed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Flip up screen works great for more than just selfies<br />+HD video<br />+High FPS video<br />+Menu options and scene selection options<br />+50ft waterproof depth<br />+Dual lock battery cover prevents accidental openings in water<br />+Quick shutter for those fast point and shoot moments<br />+Takes great pictures<br />+Very durable<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Awkward to take selfies with the screen up, fingers almost always in view<br />-Can be difficult to get used to navigating with the buttons, they feel too close together<br />-Zoom sometimes doesn't zoom, and I feel like I have to press it several times to get it to zoom.<br />-Placement of the tripod screws seems odd. I felt like it should be centered, and not to the side. It made the camera feel top heavy on my tripod<br />-Screen goes to black/white or &#34;splits image&#34; when I'm shooting video. No idea why<br />-Screen often has distorted or &#34;split image&#34; when folding it back down. Pressing the play button twice seems to fix it<br />-Can't force the flash off in some settings<br />-iAuto setting often selected the wrong scene<br /><br />Overall the camera takes good pictures, and it served me well on vacation. However, for the price, I feel like there are a lot of flaws especially compared to my previous Nikon. Perhaps the one I received is defective."

It has one huge problem and it's simply that the glass on the flip up monitor has a large scratch on it already and it's only been carried in my pockets by itself. I did see that there's screen protectors for it here on Amazon but also read that they don't stay on in water. I am going to use this in the Caribbean soon and will update this review if it gets any more scratches. Love the camera function but am very worried that this TOUGH camera is in actuality a SOFTIE when it comes to durability!

Bought it as a camera I could bring along on my kayak camping trips up north. Photos are of decent quality for a rugged camera. I really like the settings menu wheel. I find it a lot easier to navigate the menus of this camera then say the Nikon Coolpix AW-130. Which you have to navigate the menu with a series of button press's instead of a turn of a wheel toggle. Much easier for those nature shots where your subject won't be patient and wait for you to trudge through menu screens till you reach your desired setting. Although, Auto mode is my preferred setting it's still nice to have.<br /><br />Front selfie button is programmable but ultimately feels gimmicky, but unobtrusive to the main experience. Flip LCD screen will come in handy taking selfies with epic sunsets/sunrises from my kayak. Not to mention the 21mm lens to get a wider area around me.<br /><br />Overall very pleased with the fit and finish, intuitive menu layout, 21mm lens and decent photos for the category of rugged camera's. I have only dabbled in taking videos but the short videos I've made turned out nice. 1080p 60fps, par for the course.<br /><br />I like to include a negative in almost all my reviews bc items are rarely perfect. And this is no different. I had to think about what I did not like instead of its imperfections being glaring and polarizing to the rest of the camera. That would be overall size and weight is on the larger an heavy side of the spectrum.<br /><br />TLDR --- Buy this camera!!"

I was really happy with it.  The flip out screen is perfect for taking selfies.  Also the Olympus share feture allows you to share your photos to your phone without any outside wifi.  Also you can set the camera up at a distance then use your phone to take the picture. No need for the timer.  I used it almost all day on one battery charge but if I had to do it again I would buy an extra battery becuase it runs out after two hours when using video mode.  It took great pictures underwater and the built in filter modes also made for some cool pictures.  However you might just wanna take pictures in the normal mode then filter them with instagram or something.  Like I said, I took this on my honeymoon and at the end of everyday I would send the pics to my phone and upload them to social media.  So easy to do.  I shopped around for awhile but ultimatly I know I can't tell the difference between cameras.  This took great picutres and had great fetures and was real easy to use."

The 21mm lens was all that I hoped.  You can be close up to a subject and still get a lot of the subject's surrounding into the picture.  With the flip screen, you can use it to compose your selfie and view exactly what you are going to capture.  Even so, I thought it was a little troublesome to flip the screen up and down frequently.  In practice, you could just not flip the screen and point the camera at yourself and still get good shots of yourself.  I felt the flip screen was really not that necessary.  The selfie button in the front of the camera worked as it should but I thought it was in a bad position.  It is near the bottom front of the camera.  The issue is that your fingers are pinching the bottom part of the camera in order to reach the selfie button.  This can get tiring as it makes this camera feel top-heavy.  It never felt I had a good grip with the camera this way.  I think the button should have been higher up, probably in the middle front.  Because of this, I was more comfortable using the shutter button on top.  The camera starts up very fast.  It is not a small camera but I can't say it is big either.  Autofocus is also fast.  Picture quality is decent considering it has a slow f3.5 lens."

My last trip, even though I started out with a fully charged battery I missed some shots I wanted because the battery ran out of juice.  I had ordered the camera right before my trip, so didn't have time to explore all of the extras I should have had with me.  Many, many features.  Have not tested the waterproof part yet.

I have not tested the underwater rating yet but the dual lock / release on the memory card/battery compartment appears robust should prevent accidental opening .  The door seal has lots of contact area and is easy to inspect and clean.  The lens is not as fast as I would like but the image quality at high sensitivity is acceptable."

I have always liked Olympus products.  The only thing I don't like is that there's no separate battery charger, you have to hook up the camera itself, and the little &#34;door&#34; over the charger plug-in looks like it won't take a lot of use without breaking off.  I could be wrong about that, but I'll probably end up ordering a battery charger in the long run."

In that case, I got what I paid for. While the price of my new Olympus VG-160 was not that much more, I can already tell that the workmanship is much better. For instance, the housing seems far superior. The door that houses the batteries kept breaking on the Nikon. I can already tell that this should not become a problem the the Olympus as it is metal vs plastic. Setup and charging the battery which was included in the Olympus; but not in the Nikon, was extremely simple. I needed on minimal assistance from my &#34;resident guru.&#34; I love the software which came with the camera. I have already organized photos and will now be able to enjoy viewing them either on my PC or TV. So far I have only taken pictures indoors.

Our daughter is really careful with her things so we haven't had any drops or scratches.  She had no problem figuring out how to turn it on, take pictures, and view her pictures.

Unfortunate for me the screen has developed a line thru it. Does not effect the videos but I assume it will go out soon. So I did a quick search and found it is no longer available. Sooo.. without much thought I looked what else Olympus hasd to offer in the basic one button video start(I love the one button record!) and it brought me to this. A cheap feeling plastic replacement. sigh.. The lens does not meet the 7 x wide the 7040 although it does supply the 14mp but does not feel like it will last. The body just feels soooo cheap compared to the 7040.. the hinged door on this thing is not going to allow any abuse before it falls off and to top it all off.. they changed battery type to LI-70! My fault for not looking closer at this device.. but now I got a dozen batteries that I can throw away along with the charger!! ..or.. just get the Olympus LS-20m for the videos..but no pictures..sigh... hmm... anyways..its an 'ok' cheapy... nothing to be impressed with.. will update when it breaks.. sigh.. heart broken.. Amazon did a great 2 day delivery though..I guess thats something..I missed the vr-340 description which 'may have been' the better choice..more pixels 16mp and wider angle lens at same price.. it also had the one but record.. sigh. I will keep this and just get the better one next time..

Sure, I should have read up on the subject but this was an impulse purchase. Now I know that more megapixels don't translate into sharper pictures. It is more to do with the size of the sensor. My current point-and-shoot camera only has 10MP but takes better shots. It is more expensive than this model so it wouldn't be fair to make a comparison. I will save my money and buy something substantially more expensive so as to get what I want. As for the design, I prefer to control the zoom via a ring around the shutter instead of through a zoom switch on the back. On the positive side, this camera was super cheap, had a big 3&#34; LCD screen and has a fast start-up. Also, you can stitch pictures together for a panoramic shot.

I have had the worst problems with all the Nikon cameras that are this size. I figured I would give Olympus a try since my mom has had one of these for a few years and not had any problems.

Thus far I am having fun with it.

I'd bought her a fine Canon A570 a few years ago which she may have used a half-dozen times.  She found it too bulky and too complicated.  So this time I looked for a small camera that was very easy to use.  I took a chance with the VG-160 because of the good reviews on Amazon.  I added an eye-fi card so that the photos could be transferred to her computer automatically.  Thus far the camera is meeting my wife's needs.  We like its small size, sleek appearance, quick operation and simple easy-to-use controls.  Image quality is very good, especially outdoors.  The only thing we don't care for is its flash - it's underpowered - but so is the flash of most small cameras.  To counter this I set the camera to flash off and the resulting pictures are better than when the flash was used.<br /><br />My wife and I recently visited our daughter and, after my wife took a several pictures, my daughter announced that she'd like one too as a Christmas present.<br /><br />A good camera and a great bargain at $79."

I had the previous olympus pocket digital camera, and it was so much better than this.  Every time you take a picture with this camera it has to 'think' for a much longer time than any other digital camera I've ever used, before it will allow you to take another picture.  The zoom doesn't seem to work properly with the video feature.  And incredibly annoying - there's a two minute limit on video.  After 2 minutes, it stops videoing, and you can't just merely press the button for it to start again, because it has to think for a very long time before it is done processing.  It stinks.  My phone, which wasn't an expensive one, takes much better pictures and video without any of the excruciating processing time to wait through.  The camera was a total waste of my money and I'm pretty annoyed about it.<br /><br />Update: Now that I've taken pics OFF my phone, I see that it wasn't accurate to say those photos are better than the camera.  The camera's photos are better quality.  What's not good for me about the camera is the limited video and the processing time between each photo."

Last week I upgraded to an E-M1 and am totally delighted with the upgrade.  The camera is slightly bigger, slightly heavier but much better built.  The menu system is very similar to the E-M10 which is to say complex and confusing with little rhyme or reason so the transition was pretty straightforward. Some careful shopping on Amazon enabled me to buy the E-M1 for the exact same price that I had paid for the E-M10.  Very highly recommended."

You can send the camera in to Olympus for repair but they will check it at room temperature and return it as not needing to be repaired. Tech support personnel claim to be unaware of the problem but I have found posts on the internet regarding the problem dating back to 2012. I had hoped that by 2015 that Olympus would have fixed the problem, but they have not bothered to do so and are pretending that it does not exist.<br /><br />I have been using cameras for more than 40 years and this Olympus is the first to fail within 60 days of use. No matter how great the rest of the camera may be, when it locks up you have nothing and this is an expensive camera to have to use only in warm weather. Fortunately on our expensive trip to Yellowstone where the OM-D E-M1 camera failed, we had the Olympus Pen 7 camera and it continued to work perfectly.<br /><br />Olympus is getting ready to discontinue this camera model and I would recommend getting anything else and when the new model does arrive to replace the OM-D E-M1 to wait 6 months and then look for reviews and posts to verify that the new model does not share the defective shutter mechanism of the Olympus OM-D E-M1"

But as to the sellers...Yes it is a free world and you can sell whatever you want at whatever price and eventually someone may buy it . I did not order mine Through Willoughby but through Amazon...It just galls me that Willoughby is charging so much more than Amazon...but if you got money to throw  away....why not give that extra money to your favorite charity...you'll eventually get your camera and your heart will feel good...and make many more people happy...just my .02 cents<br /><br />December 22 2013 update...For me this has become an awesome sports shooting machine...the auto tracking works wonderfully on here . I shoot ice hockey and rugby and this ...not so little camera...does an amazing job...I have a lot more keepers...I shoot ISO 1600 at indoor ice rinks with good results...some rinks are not as bright as others and am forced to shoot ISO 3200 ...results are pretty nice....but sometimes if in a dark corner of a rink at this ISO noise can get pretty ugly...but as for rugby...well that is outdoors for me...no issues with lighting at all...can't wait for the 40-150 2.8<br /><br />Also this camera with the 12-40 2.8 is no lightweight and it is fairly large. I do not recommend this setup for street photography . I have the 17 1.8 on order and I will use that lens to shoot street with this camera...also the shutter does make a sound ...but it is more on the muffled side...and actually if you want to shoot street with a mft camera the GX7 might be a better choice....smaller camera...silent shutter...and the price just came down again...I expect panasonic to drop that price even lower...I can wait...still love my nikon 1 V1 for street with the 10 mm<br /><br />I am not one for gimmicky things on a camera...but on this I really like creating a collage in camera...really useful and fun feature<br /><br />Jan 2 , 2014 update...this is a great mirrorless camera  and a great MFT camera...but really it is just a great camera...I have been using this with the 17 1.8 and I love it more and more . I have shot portraits with it...doggie portraits...and recently went to a first night celebration parade and this camera performed excellently...I need to get out more often at night and shoot...really this outperforms 'professional cameras of the past...the tracking is amazing...not d4 quality but very respectable...wish it had a silent shutter...I think that is all it is missing...been using the video a little more and it is very nice...once I figured out what I was doing"

But I also shoot micro 4/3 when I want to travel light. I have used both the Panasonic GF1 and the GX1. When both the GX7 and E-M1 were announced, it was a tough call. I went with the E-M1 because of the excellent weather sealing, a better grip, and of course the renowned IBIS (Image stabilization) system that got rave reviews on their previous model, the E-M5.<br />When I received my pre-order from Amazon, I knew I was holding a serious piece of photography equipment in my hand. It just feels rock solid. I paired it with the Panasonic 12-35mm f2.8, and the combination is just outstanding. Focusing is as quick as the D800, and I love the pictures that come straight out of the camera. As of this writing, I haven't managed to process the RAW files so my impressions are based only on the JPG output.<br />The IBIS is just outstanding. I have shot at 1/10th of a second and the images are tack sharp. Some reviewers have posted handheld images shot at 1 and 2 seconds, which seems mind boggling.<br />The price does seem a bit steep, but it is worth every cent.<br />If you are into micro four-third, this is the camera to get."

It is an expensive camera body that will make you want to buy different lenses to further improve your non existent skills. It may even make you want to learn more about photography. At least, that is what has happened for me in the past 5 days of using this camera. The price has killed me internally, but has been well-worth the amazing images out of the box. I am very frugal, so buying this camera was way out of my comfort zone.<br /><br />It has a steep learning curve if you want to pursue additional features, but otherwise, you truly can use it as an automatic point and shoot. The low light performance is amazing, and I am very pleased with how in near darkness, I can get great images of my kids playing in their forts. I am excited to see what kind of images I can get on Halloween night - no more grainy shots without a flash, and no more washed out ghouls and Freddie Krugers like from the old days with my flash on the old camera. You can get a lot of results without the flash.<br /><br />I am also using it to record video of performances. Again - much improved results in low light. I wouldn't ditch my video recorder just yet, but it is impressive what I am able to record.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and do not get anything smaller then the 32g removable storage if you plan on using lots of video and or shooting in sports mode with burst speeds.Trust me. - remember, I told you wouldn't lie. You are better off splurging for at least 64gb.<br /><br />Sports setting - This will shoot at 10 frames per second. When shooting my son's football game last night, I realized the fast frames per second went almost faster than I could see. I was looking through the view finder and shooting the action, but was worried that the images wouldn't come out. They were crisp and perfect, and while I dumped 70% of the shots, 30% were great action shots that left this parent really pleased.<br /><br />The Wifi connection is wonderful and I was able to control the camera from my phone  - that will be helpful if we try to do a holiday self-portrait this year - no more setting the camera on a 10 second timer and racing to get into the photo.<br /><br />One added bonus  - I look better in photos from this camera then with the last camera. Not younger or thinner - just better.<br /><br />We like to hike and bike, and this camera is perfectly portable. The footprint is so much smaller, so it is easy to lug it around. In fact, you won't feel as if you are lugging anything around. The weatherproofing is a bonus, and I hear that they tested the camera after it was buried in snow for 15 minutes, and it still performed perfectly. Don't take it swimming - but you can bring it out into the elements with no adverse affects.<br /><br />Because of the expense, I would suggest finding out the return policy before you buy and try. You may find it isn't the camera for you, but I would hate for you to be resentful that you splurged on a camera because I recommended it!<br /><br />Have fun :-)",

The first is order this camera and either the MMF-3 (needed to shoot 4/3 lenses on the EM1) or the  FL-300R at the same time and get reimbursed for the cost of the accessory.  The second is order the EM1 and the 12-40mm and get $200 back.  Both of these promotions can be used with one camera purchase.  I have put the links in the comments section.<br /><br />If I were only allowed to own one camera but could choose any camera I wanted in the world, the EM1 would be the camera I would choose (The GX7 would be the next if the EM1 was not available).  This camera is an almost faultless camera that is a real joy to hold and use.  Oh, it also makes amazing photographs.  It is one of the best built cameras around.  It feels nice and solid and every switch has the perfect feel to it.  There is no better built or nicer feeling camera in any price range.  While I am more of a function over form type of person, the jewel like quality of this camera does up the emotional joy of using this camera.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I need to digress here to address two ridiculous arguments I read all over the web and then hear parroted by people who have no idea what they are talking about.  I hate wasting time and if you are not interested then skip down to the asterisk and the review will continue there.<br /><br />The first bit of misinformation deals with what I call sensor envy.  It goes something like this: m43 is a fine stop gap measure until you can afford a so called 'full-frame' sensor and thus are able to become a real photographer.  This is a pretty complex issue so I have put a great deal of detail in a discussion on the subject at the end of this review.  I've also attached a video I made from E-M1 photographs.  Also, I have put a challenge at the end of the video.  I have included 16 photos taken from a 35mm, a DX, and m43 sensors.  There are at least 3 images from each size sensor.  Unfortunately because it is so small it is not as spectacular as 1080p on a TV but even so if you like the EM1 photos and can't easilly tell the difference between sensors in the challenge, you might just be amazed and overjoyed with the EM1.<br /><br />The short version of what you need to know about sensor IQ is it is very much like horsepower in a car.  A lot of people want as much horsepower as they can get.  However, the fact of the matter is the fastest speed limit in America is 80 mph.  Because of this anything over 100 hp is really overkill.  You pay for the extra horsepower with a heavier car which costs more and burns more gas.  Same thing goes with cameras, the sensor IQ of just about every camera exceeds what most people need, so it is other features that are more important today.  But just like car magazines make sales on exciting super cars, camera sites generate sales and enthusiasm trumpeting how everyone should someday own a 35mm sensor to be a real photographer.  It is an emotional ploy to sell more cameras. (A much more detailed discussion can be found after the review).<br /><br />The second issue is a continuation of the sensor envy and goes something to the effect of Olympus is really pushing the bounds of what can be charged for a m43 sensor.  In the original version of this review I showed how the EM1 is better than the Nikon D600 in many aspects and yet is cheaper.  However, I think that may have given the impression that I don't feel the EM1 is overpriced (I think Olympus is one of the worst for overpricing their cameras).  My point was actually that, with the exception of Sony, all the major manufactures overprice their cameras and the web sites should be pointing that out for Nikon and Canon as well as m43 manufactures.  With the announcement of the 24 mp 35mm Sony A7 for $1700 and 36mp 35mm Sony A7r, the Canon 6D, 1Ds Mk III, Nikon D600, and Nikon D800 have instantly gone obsolete.  I am guessing Sony is selling the cameras below cost to gain market share.  I will talk more about the A7 in the buying guide at the end of the review..<br /><br />*********************************************************************************<br />*  Start Review Here<br />*********************************************************************************<br /><br />I have owned or shot extensively tons of cameras so I am pretty familiar with brands and how cameras work.(Canon 1Ds MkII, 30D, Nikon D3, D300, D600, D700, D7000, D800, Panasonic G1, GF1, GH1, GH2, G3, GX7, Olympus E-P1, E-30, E-M5, Leica M8, M9, Fuji X100).  M4/3 are great cameras which are, in my opinion, the best choice for probably 95% of households looking for a large sensor camera.<br /><br />The first thing I want to really point out is the EVF.  It is huge and bright.  It also has a 1.48x magnification.  Most OVF are doing well to offer a .7x magnification.  What that means is OVFs are making the image 30% smaller while the EM1 EVF is making the image 48% larger.  This helps in focusing and framing.  While I won't go as far as saying it is revolutionary, it really does change the game for the better is a joy to use.  Many pros sites say they prefer the view from a large FX prism.  In most cases I actually prefer EVF.  The reason is the EVF is mostly What You See Is What You Get.  That means if you set a manual WB and then forgot to change it when you changed settings, you will see that in the EVF as the picture will look either to yellow or blue.  I also use the EVF as a very fast method of setting exposure.  Move the light sources around in the frame until you see the exposure you want and then lock it in.  Recompose and shoot.  This is an exceedingly fast way to play with your exposure and you can't do that with an OVF.<br /><br />The next feature is revolutionary and it is the 5 axis IBIS.  This was included in the EM5 which was the real revolution but the 5 axis in the EM1 is even better.  To give you an example, I can get about a 70% non-blurry hit rate shooting a 75mm f/1.8 at 1.6 seconds.  I got about a 20% hit rate at 2' so I really recommend 1.6' max.  If you have bad holding technique or shaky hands this feature is going to help you take better pictures.  If you are taking pictures above your head or down at your feet, this will help steady the shot.  There are IS systems in lenses and other camera bodies but none of them can touch the 5 axis IBIS in the EM1.  For video, it is good enough to eliminate the need for mechanical IS systems.  So for home users, even video taken while walking can be nice and smooth.<br /><br />The handling on this camera is the best in the world.  It can be exceedingly simple to use or if you really want to customize your camera it has the ability to do that as well.  I have read in another review that this camera is complicated to use even in iAuto mode.  I am not sure what that person was referring to.  In iAuto the camera does everything for you.  It sets shutter speed, aperture, ISO, white balance and scene mode.  There is nothing you need to do except press the shutter button.  The camera does everything else for you.  I have also read on too many sites that Olympus menus are poor and are overly complicated.  First off, most of the people writing these comments have been using Canon's or Nikon's poor and complicated mens for so many years that they have them memorized and can work them.  I am not going to say they are great or intuitive to use but then again neither are anyone else's.  However, the fact of the matter is after you use 1 or 2 of the menus to set up the camera you don't need to use them.  Olympus has a Quick Menu system that you activate by pressing the OK button in the center of the 4 direction controller.  Now for some reason on the EM1, it is not switched on as default.  So you will need to switch it on in both iAuto and PASM mode.  Once you have the Quick Menu up you can change any relevant shooting parameter you need without going into the menus.<br /><br />Another feature to mention about the EM1 is the Auto White Balance is amazingly good.  In every situation I have shot it has been spot on.  The only cameras I have shot before with AWB this good are the Fuji X100 and EM5.  Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Leica all leave something to be desired when it comes to AWB.<br /><br />This camera is the upgrade path from the E5.  I am not going to go into exhaustive details between the differences.  You do need the MMF-3 to shoot 4/3 lenses with the EM1.  First, subjectively, the phase auto focus on the EM1 is not as fast as E5 or E30.  There are no cross type sensors on the EM1.  The difference between the 2 is really not that noticeable in real world shooting.  4/3 lenses, however, are noticeably slower than m4/3 lenses but still fast enough to get the job done.  The EM1 only has a tilt screen instead of fully articulated one.  Other than that, this camera completely outclasses the E5 in all categories to include IQ.  At least a 2 stop increase in dynamic range.<br /><br />The single shot autofocus on this camera is very fast.  Fast enough to keep up with little kids running around in low light situations.  With the 25mm f/1.4 it is near instantaneous in good light.  However its low light performance is not as good as the GX7. (The GX7 has the fastest low light performance I have ever seen.) With, the 25mm f/1.4 the EM1 auto focus was similar to the GX7 with no hunting.  However, with the 70mm f1.8, the camera often had to hunt to find the focus.<br /><br />M4/3 (including the EM5) have been a little hobbled in the past with a poor 1/160 flash sync and a lame 1/4000 fastest shutter speed.  The EM1, however, has a flash sync speed of 1/320 which is I believe faster than any DSLR which top out at 1/250.  Not really fast enough to get really excited about but fast enough to be useful.  The 1/8000 max shutter speed is also welcome as I like to shoot wide open primes in bright light and don't like toting around ND filters.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Olympus did not build this pro-body with 2 card slots.  Two cards are really nice for paid events for redundancy in case one card dies on you.  With the amazing 12-40mm f2.8 on its way, this camera is an great events camera.  However, when your getting paid for your pictures you really want the redundancy of 2 card slots.  This camera also, has built in wifi.  Following the directions in the manual it was very easy to set up.  The Olympus generates a QR code which you take a picture of with your phone and then the app sets everything up.  Now with that said, I don't think wifi is going to be that useful for me.  If you need to remotely control a camera then this would be ok.  I could see a portrait studio having the camera set up on a tripod and using the phone to trigger the camera.  The reason I say this is ok is that the focus seemed really slow.  Also, it can transfer photos to your phone to upload to the web, so if that is something you have been waiting for then this will be useful for you.  However, a really nice feature of the EM1 wifi allows you to geo-tag your photos with your phones GPS coordinates.  This is something I might actually use.  This is also an intermittently updated function so it doesn't drain your phone and camera battery as much.<br /><br />M4/3 cameras are so small and light that I use them with a wrist strap instead of a neck strap. The grip on this camera is finally as good as the Panasonic G and GH series camera.  To me, grips point in the same direction as the lens so, as far as camera size goes when including the lens, it is essentially free as it doesn't make the system any deeper.  However, for camera real estate it provides a nice anchoring point and place to put the shutter release.  Bravo.  I have read this camera is it is too big.  However, when you sit it side-by-side with the GX7, it is about the same height and depth.  The extra height comes from the EVF poking out of the top and depth from the grip in the front.  Also is it is the size of the system that needs to be considered not the size of the camera.  Either of these cameras with a 100-300 is going to be a rather large camera.  However, both are going to be pretty small with a 14mm f2.5.<br /><br />All in all this is a fantastic little camera, that handles beautifully, takes great pictures.  If you want the best m43 camera available, this is it.  However, the GX7 matches the EM1 in most categories and best it in some (Auto focus speed, 40fps burst mode, silent mode) and is $500 cheaper.  The GX7 is going to be the better camera for most people.  However, there are a few situations where the E-M1 might be better for you than the GX7.  If you have 4/3 lenses, the E-M1 is a no brainer as the auto focus of those lenses are  much faster on the EM1.  If you don't know what I am talking about you don't have any.  If you need the extra battery life of the grip or you take tons of portrait orientation pictures, the E-M1 is the way to go.  If you want the best IBIS in any camera system, that will be in the EM1.  If you want the most weather sealed m4/3 camera that will also be the EM1.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Revolutionary 5 Axis IBIS<br />Very Fast Auto Focus<br />Very fast 4/3 auto focus<br />World Leading Auto White Balance<br />World Leading Build Quality<br />Image Quality<br />1.48x EVF<br />Small and light<br />World Leading Handling<br />Len System<br /><br />Cons:<br />Only one SD slot<br /><br />Buying guide recommendation.<br /><br />Sony A7 or A7r - These are going to be amazing cameras at an amazing price and Olympus has priced the EM1 into where the $1700 A7 may be a consideration for someone looking to spend that much.  As I have said in this review, the IQ on these cameras is going to be better than the EM1 so if ultimate image quality is your goal these will be your cameras.  While these cameras are very small, the lenses are not.  Sony is trying to avoid this issue with the lenses they released.  The 35mm f2.8 is the most noticeable.  That is a very slow prime and is going to give the same DOF as an 17mm f/1.4 and only slightly more DOF control than the 17mm f/1.8.  However, when Sony does release the 35mm f/1.7 or f/1.4 it is going to be a very large lens.  Additionally, the  24-70mm f/4 lens is 1 stop slower than the Olympus 12-40mm f/2.8 and yet is larger and heavier, while having 10mm less zoom than the Olympus.  Sony's contrast autofocus is not as fast as Olympus or Panasonic.  So given a shallower DOF, the autofocus is going to be noticeably slower than the EM1.  Brilliant cameras to be sure but they are not going to be as good all around as the EM1 is.  For full disclosure, I have no intention of selling my m43 gear.  However, I am very seriously considering selling all of my Nikon gear and buying into this system.<br /><br />Sony RX10 - A stunning little camera.  If you want a high quality camera with a pro-grade 24-200mm f/2.8 zoom, and don't want to buy other lenses, this camera may be for you.  It is only a 1' sensor so it is smaller than m43 so it will be even harder to get really shallow DOF.  However, it is a back illuminated sensor (something I think m43 should have done a long time ago) so it is very likely this camera will exceed m43 and many APS-C cameras for low light performance.  Combine that with a constant 2.8 24-200mm pro-zoom and you have an amazing combination.  The only downside I see for this is you are marrying a very expensive lens to a sensor.  With interchangeable lenses systems, once you spring for the expensive lens, you can continue to reuse it as you purchase newer camera bodies.  If that doesn't bother you, this is going to be a stunning camera.<br /><br />Panasonic GX7 - Panasonic's best still camera to date - Great construction, 1/320 flash sync, 1/8000 shutter speed, blazing fast focus, WIFI, IBS, focus peeking, great handling, etc.  This camera does cost $150 more than the NEX-6, which is similarly specked (Sony must be giving them away).  However, m4/3 lenses are always going to be quite a bit smaller and lighter than NEX lenses.  Additionally, the m4/3 lens system is the most complete outside of legacy 35mm systems from Nikon and Canon.<br /><br />Panasonic G6 - Great little camera for a nice price ($650 with lens).  IQ not quite as good as the EM1, build quality not as good as GX7, and has slower flash sync and shutter speed.  It has a tilt and swivel screen which in my opinion is actually nicer than the tilt only screen on the GX7, EM5, and EM1.  If you want to get into the system, this is a good way to start.  Save money on the camera and spend it on a nice lens.<br /><br />Panasonic G5 - Right now if you look for the clearance sales you can get them for $300-400.  Not as good as any of the other cameras here but still a great camera which takes nice pictures.<br /><br />Olympus E-M5 - this camera has now been outclassed by the GX-7 and costs the same.  So while this is still a brilliant camera, the GX-7 is better for the same money.<br /><br />Olympus E-P5 - Has no built in view finder which for me is an absolute no go. Get either the E-M5, GX-7 or E-M1<br /><br />NEX-6 - Really nice camera - Focus is not as fast a m4/3.  Sensor is bigger so for higher ISO it will have better IQ.  Price is great.  However, this camera does not handle as well as the Panasonic.  While the camera is small, the lenses are not so this system is not as small and light as the m4/3.  The lens system is nowhere near complete as the m4/3 system.  If price is your only consideration, then the NEX-6 is probably the way to go.<br /><br />Any DSLR -  Bigger and heaver - DSLRs are dinosaurs when compared to mirrorless cameras.  I really hate going back from shooting my E-M1 to shooting my Nikons.  They are big, the focus system is obsolete (not phase focus, but the focus points and how they are arranged).  The, live view is terrible, most of the viewfinders are smaller then the newest EVFs, and are lacking some of the features of the mirrorless.  Tons of people buy Nikon and Canon because that is what is around,  however, my opinion is the vast majority of families would be much better served by a m4/3 system.<br /><br />*********************************************************************************<br />* Start thesis on Sensor Size<br />*********************************************************************************<br />Is a FX sensor better than a m4/3?  Is a m4/3 sensor better than a FX?  The answer to both those questions is 'It depends.'  Anyone who tries to give you a one size fits all answer either has no clue what they are talking about or are trying to sell you something.  I will attempt to try and explain the relative merits of each so you can make an informed decision.  I am really only going to discuss FX (AKA 35mm or mislabeled as full-frame.  Whatever that even really means as there are medium format cameras and large format cameras with much larger imaging circles.) as what I say about it will apply to DX to a lessor extent.<br /><br />The 4 major components of IQ are Resolution, Color Depth, Dynamic Range, and High ISO.  You can if you want go to DXOMark and look at all the sensor data.  I will give you numbers for the best of breed of each size.  D800 36mp, 25.3 bit color depth, 14.4 Stop Dynamic Range and 2853 ISO.  For D7100 it is 24mp, 24.2, 13.7 and 1256.  For EP5, 16mp, 22.8, 12.4, 895.  Higher is 'better' and so by numbers the IQ of the FX D800 is best.  (I am using the EP5 because there is not DxOMark Score for the EM1.  Before, we move on to some other items concerning sensor, let me show you the numbers for the 2006 35mm Canon 1Ds MkII.  Before I show them to you, you need to know this was a pro-camera that cost $8000 when it came out and at 16.7mp was the first 35mm digital considered capable of shooting double-truck ads for national magazines.  Here are the numbers for this camera 16mp, 23.3, 11.3, 1480.  So, based on objective numbers, the m43 sensor of today is about equivalent of the camera used for pro work in 2006 to 2008.  It actually has a better dynamic range than the 35mm camera does.  (A comment I want to make concerning the ISO numbers.  I am not sure how these are computed or relate to each other.  I shot with the 1Ds MkII extensively and I can without a doubt say the files from the EM5 look better than the 1Ds Mk II at 6400 ISO.  Also, you can go to DPReview and see 100% magnified files shot at various ISOs and various cameras.  The files from the D800  look to me about 1 to 1.5 stops better than the EM5.  That is the D800 files at 6400 look the same with regard to noise as EM5 shot at 3200.)  Just for info purposes here are some of numbers from some other older cameras I shot with.  Canon 30D 10mp, 21.5, 10.8, 736 and Nikon D300, 12mp, 22.1, 12, 679.  As you can see the EP5 outclasses both of those cameras based on the numbers and yet I got really nice pictures with both those cameras. (Going back to that ISO number again, I shot extensively with both of those cameras and their files at ISO 800 were about the same as the EM5 at 6400. The EM5 is about 3 stops better yet the DxOMark ISO values are about the same.  Also, the EM5 6400 JPEGs are sharp and clean.  Very nice.)  If all you care about is IQ and you need all that IQ, then by all means the D800 is even better than the best medium format except in color depth used for portraits so get the D800.<br /><br />However, as I showed you with the 1Ds MkII, the IQ of sensors, long ago exceeded what we need for home use.  So the fact of the matter is, most people don't need the IQ of the D800 and there are, to me, more relevant reasons why the D800 is not something most people would even like.  The first is 36mp files.  Shot in 14bit RAW, you are looking at around a 65MB image file.  Roughly, 15 of those images make 1GB.  Even the JPEGs are huge around 15MB each.  That is a pain to store and a pain to process.  What do most people do with their images?  I would say the number 1 thing people do is is to put them on the web or their phones.  The biggest monitors are around 2.5mp.  To print a 300dpi 8x10 requires around 7mp. Requires.  That means if you view the picture on a 2.5mp monitor you giving up 33.5mp.  (This is not entirely accurate as the image is interpolated down and you do clean up noise when you do that.)  That is for a full screen image not the little happy snaps you text or put on facebook which are more likely to be around 1mp or less.  Do you really think you need 36mp?  If so, then m4/3 is not the right format for me.  I personally, like the 10-12mp range (and wish they would make a 12mp m43) but 16mp is more than enough for me.  I mentioned earlier, that when you downsize an image it is interpolated down and this helps clean up the image.  Well that applies to the m4/3 images as well.  So even though the D800 is 1 to 1.5 stops better for noise, when you interpolate the images down, you are very unlikely to be able to see that on your screen or even on a print except at ISOs greater than 6400 or maybe 3200.  So I think we have established the FX sensor has better IQ than m4/3 but I hope I have established for most people it just doesn't matter because the m4/3 sensors are more than good enough for tasks most people use cameras for.<br /><br />So what are the downsides of FX sensors.  The first and most obvious is price, although with Nikon's D600 fiasco, you can get a FX sensor for around $1500.  However, the other costs associated with the FX sensor are the lenses.  The best lenses are very expensive.  Also, the imaging circle of a FX is roughly 2x the size of the imaging circle of m4/3.  That means, the lenses are going to be bigger and heavier and the difference is not trivial.  A D800 with a 70-200mm f.28 is going to set you back about $5300 and around 6-7lbs.  A EM1 with a 40-150mm f/2.8 will set you back about $2300 and around 3lbs.  I can and have carried 4 m4/3 bodies with 2 fast zooms and 2 fast primes in the same bag I can only carry 2 DSLR bodies and lenses.  I also carried several extra lenses in that bag.  The weight of that bag, bodies, lenses, and iPad was 10lbs.  Two FX bodies and fast zooms alone are going to weigh more than that.  If you really feel like you want to lug all that around, then by all means get the FX.  All that weight also means you will be carrying around a heavier tripod if you use one. Do you think if maybe you had to hike your camera in somewhere that maybe the smaller sensor might be better?  If you are traveling somewhere and carrying your camera all day, can you see how the smaller sensor would be better?  Something to think about.<br /><br />Next, the contrast autofocus use by m4/3 is on the sensor and it is exceedingly fast.  What this means, is you have focusing points throughout your frame.  The phase detect systems used on FX DSLRs only has points clustered around the middle.  The corners are excluded.  Also, the phase detect systems are separate from the sensor.  Therefore, with FX you have back focusing and front focusing issues.  The so called live view systems on the DSLRs are really the only accurate way to auto or manual focus and is terribly slow (What you see thought the prism is not what the sensor is seeing it is what the autofocus is seeing.)  That means the only way to quickly frame and focus a FX DSLR is through the viewfinder.  Forget holding the camera over your head or down at your feet.<br /><br />The next issue is with dust on the sensor.  With all my DX and FX sensors DSLRs, dust has always been an issue (Talk about a way to ruin image quality).  It was so bad on the D600 they have had to significantly drop the price on that camera.  In almost 5 years shooting m4/3, I have never had 1 single problem with dust on the sensor.<br /><br />Another 'benefit' of FX is the shallower Depth of Field that can be achieved for the same aperture.  The reason I put that in quotes is that in a lot of cases the DOF on a FX is too shallow and you need to stop down the lens to f4 or f5.6 to get the DOF you are looking for.  In these cases, a m4/3 is clearly superior as you can stay at f2 or f2.8 to get the same DOF.  This means you are collecting 4 times the light and, therefore, you can turn your ISO down 2 stops (According to the images on DPReview, a 100% EM5 image at 1600 looks better than a D800 6400 image).  Also, for flash or lighting for video filming, a 2 stop ISO difference means 4 times less light power is required for the m4/3 sensor. That means your flash batteries will last longer and your flash will recycle that much quicker.<br /><br />Another drawback of the FX sensor is it is stuck in the archaic 2:3 ratio which is not as friendly for printing as a 4:3 ration is.  To print a 4:5 ration 8x10 from a 2:3 ratio there is quite a bit of cropping to be done and often a picture won't fit.<br /><br />Finally, the pixel densities on m4/3 are the highest of any large sensor camera.  A DX sensor with the same pixel density as a 16mp m4/3 sensor would be roughly 32mp and a FX sensor would be 64mp.  This is both good and bad for m4/3 cameras.  Currently, there are no DX or FX sensors with pixel densities of the m4/3.  So you are currently getting more reach on your m4/3 lenses than any other lenses.  What this means is, given the same focal length, you are getting approximately 1.5x the data on a subject for the same area than an FX and 1.25 vs a DX sensor.  This is not to be confused with crop factor which based on the sensor size is 2x compared to FX sensor and 1.5x compared to a DX sensor. This does come with a downside to the m4/3 in that it works your lenses harder (exposes optical flaws in the lenses) and you hit diffraction limits on IQ at around F8 vice F11.<br /><br />Since you have read this far, I am going to talk about the new Sony A7 and A7r which is going to be Sony's new mirroless 35mm interchangeable lens camera systems with 24mp and 36mp.  Do these tempt me are make me want to wait.  The answer to those questions is not at all.  Everything I has said above still holds true for the now Sonys.  Even with the Sony in the mix, my first choice for a camera would be an EM1.  However, if ultimate image quality is the most important fact to you, I think the A7 systems are going to be stunning and will probably drive Leica out of the camera making business.  I think Leica lenses will be incredibly popular on these systems.<br /><br />Buy 35mm FX if:<br />- You need the best image quality available to print big.  At 200 dpi (good enough for most people) you can print a 16mp image up to 23x17.  If you need bigger than that, get a FX.<br />- You absolutely have to have the shallowest DOF available in a DSLR body.  I've owned FX camera bodies and I will admit sometimes I do miss the razor shall DOF images I was occasionally able to capture.  With that, however, the DOF was so small I often missed the focus especially on wiggly subjects such as kids.  Also, with 2 or more people, DOF at 1.4 was way too shallow so forget about it. With my 75mm 1.8, I don't miss FX as much as my pictures from that lens have a very similar feel as the FX pictures.  I liked the D700 a lot but the fact of the matter is, I used my GH1 far more.<br />- You have to have the biggest sensor to feel good about yourself. (And, really, you will still need MF)"
Olympus,Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mirrorless Camera with Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm f/2.8 PRO Lens,20131014,B00IZKTNJ6,5,27,34,"on October 14, 2013",ANONYMOUS,A great camera with a steep learning curve,"Warning:  The OM-D E-M1  is not for the faint of heart.  It takes excellent photos when it does what I expect, which isn't all the time.  The controls have a steep learning curve, which I haven't climbed yet.  I'm going to give it five stars on the assumption that I'll climb that mountain.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Takes great photos, if you know what you're doing.<br />* Battery let's you take at least 300 photos per charge, even with some flash.<br />* Fast shutter delay; very responsive (even if you don't want it to be).<br />* Can change settings on the fly quickly, if you know what you're doing.<br />* Six-hour sleep; you don't have to turn the camera off most of the time.<br />* iPad/Smartphone app works pretty well via WiFi, if you know what you're doing<br />* Olympus tech support is excellent.<br />* Lightweight and strong, even with a lens attached, with an easy grip.<br />* LED screen is very good and shows a greed deal of information.<br />* Viewfinder is excellent.<br /><br />Cons<br />* Pricey.<br />* Steep learning curve.  Even on 'auto' you have to know a little about the controls.<br />* Buttons are so sensitive that you can easily change settings or take unwanted photos.<br />* Included added flash is only okay.<br />* Lens designed to be bundled with this camera isn't out as of this writing (10/14/13) and will be pricey.<br /><br />I've had the camera for more than two weeks, and have gone through two batteries to take several hundred photos (look for me on Facebook), so feel I can comment, from a mid-level user's perspective.  Most cameras I've owned have powerful controls, but if you just want to set it to 'Auto' and take pics, a beginner can do it.  Not so this camera.<br /><br />The default settings for the OMD1 (how I tend to refer to it) are for the high-end user... with some odd exceptions.  The arrow buttons change the focus.  This is incredibly annoying, given how sensitive the buttons are, and if you don't pay attention the focus point will be waaaay off very easily.  You can change how the arrow buttons work, but that reduces a great deal of the ease of the Live Screen controls.  There is no command to lock the focus.  Meanwhile, the default for the lever is 'off'.  If you want to use the AF or HDR buttons to change the flash settings, you have to go into the menus and turn on the lever.<br /><br />Most of the menu commands and settings have at least three ways of accessing them.  This is good, as you'll probably want to turn off one or two.  If you set it up right, one button gets you access to flash settings, HDR exposures, etc.  The front and back dials give you control of two aspects on one screen.  The touch screen commands take a delicate touch, but work well.  I haven't even played with the function buttons yet.<br /><br />The upside to the very sensitive controls: Almost no shutter delay.  The OMD1 is very responsive.  This is not always a good thing, if you happen to hit a button at the wrong time or chose the wrong setting by mistake.  A little care is required.<br /><br />Turning on the camera wakes it up quickly, but you don't even have to do that; 'sleep'k kicks in after a minute (by default) and lasts 6 hours, so merely touching a button wakes it up.  The battery has to handle a lot, but so far each charge has lasted over 300 shots.  Haven't tried energy draining aspects like HDR combinations or RAW.<br /><br />The manual is very good, and Olympus tech support is excellent (1-800-201-7766 press 1 (maybe))).<br /><br />The viewfinder is great, though I usually use Live View.<br /><br />Every now and then, the camera does something odd (such as take a photo for 2 seconds) that I didn't set up and don't quite understand why.  I'm assuming that all will become clear in the fullness of time.  This is mostly in low-light situations where the flash hasn't decided what to do.<br /><br />L SF (Large/Super Fine)  .jpg compression puts it at resolution of 350 and smaller height x width, which means I have to massage the files in Photoshop more than I want to, even for simple Facebook uploads.  This is the setting that gives the most info this side of RAW (according to tech support) and so what I, in theory, want.  The excellent compression and great focusing mean the extra steps in Photoshop are worth the results.<br /><br />When the camera is doing what I expect, the images are excellent.  Massaged in PS, they come out very nice.  Sharp and clean.<br /><br />The focusing works spectacularly well.  I'm not sure how the AE works.  It seems to be about a quarter f-stop off, at least for the people's faces when the background is lighter.  I hope to figure out how to highlight the faces better.<br /><br />WiFi connection via app to my iPad works, but is also non-intuitive.  The app is brand new, just released, an update of a previous Olympus app. The connection, which should be simple, is handled strangely:  The 'Connection to Smartphone' is in a different menu than the settings for wifi connection, and you can't get out of the wifi screen when it's on.  You either use the camera manually OR connect via WiFi.  You have to change some settings on the iPad to connect and to allow access to the files on the camera.<br /><br />My standard lens is the M.Zuiko ED 12-50mm f3.5-63.  This lens works fine, as does the ED 40-150 zoom I also got.  The newer Micro 4/3rd lens designed for the OMD1 isn't out yet, and the price makes me hesitate.  If I get a third lens, it's likely to be the 45mm f1.8.  But let me get used to the camera before I start collecting lenses.<br /><br />So:  final word, for now:  An exceptionally good camera that takes great photos... when the symbiosis between photographer and equipment is complete.  I do not yet grok the OMD1. I am going to give it five stars because the small camera takes great pictures.  But please, note all the caveats."
Olympus,Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mirrorless Camera with Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm f/2.8 PRO Lens,20131014,B00IZKTNJ6,5,188,203,"on October 14, 2013",ANONYMOUS,"As a whole, the best mirrorless camera made today (2013)","I have thoroughly used and reviewed this camera over the past several weeks (review sample from Olympus) and have been wowed, shocked and surprised at the results. I originally thought this would be an E-M5 with a better build, feel and faster AF and at the end of the day I found it to be much more. Due to the lack of an AA filter, the IQ has indeed been enhanced. Images are sharper/crisper and the high ISO has also been improved. I have written 5700 words on this camera and shared a ton of images as well as a comparison against a Leica M. At the end of the day this camera is so good, I ordered one from Amazon for myself.<br /><br />Below is my 'FInal Conclusion' from the full review I posted on my website on the E-M1:<br /><br />Well here we are in 2013 and the choices for all of us crazy enthusiasts are plentiful and excellent. We finally have a definitive Micro 4/3 camera body that is pro level and can do just about anything one needs it to do and do it in any weather. As always, I review cameras from an enthusiasts point of view in a real world way. There are things I do not even get into like Flash, because I have not used a flash in 14 years. I am anti-flash even though I know it is good to have on some occasions. But as an enthusiast and a passionate photographer who has seen it all and used them all, I can say with confidence that the OM-D E-M1 is one of the best cameras 'as a whole' that I have ever reviewed. It is superb. Yes, there are others with better overall IQ and others with better high ISO but as a whole, speaking of the whole package, nothing else has come close.<br /><br />You have seen me rant and rave about a few different camera models over the year. Leica's and Sony's for the most part. Well as of today there is a new camera in town that offers the perfect mix of speed, usability, build, image quality, cost and lenses to place it at the top of the heap in the world of mirrorless cameras. Someone asked me today if I would take a Canon 6D and 85L or an E-M1 and 25 1.4. For me that choice is easy. The E-M1 only because it would go with me everywhere when the 6D would be left behind. It is just too large, too bulky and too heavy and the lenses, while fantastic are just too much weight wise for everyday use.<br /><br />The image quality of the E-M1 is an improvement over the E-M5 due to the new processor and lack of an AA filter. The files pop more and I feel they also have slightly different color that I prefer. Crisp. Beautiful. The exposure metering is fantastic, the AWB is fantastic, the out of camera colors are beautiful.<br /><br />There will always be naysayers no matter what towards this Micro 4/3 system. But those who disregard or trash Micro 4/3 or the E-M1 have no idea what they are doing or saying. There is simply nothing to trash and that is fact.<br /><br />It will not match full frame like the RX1 or M in all out flat out IQ but it will meet head to head ANY APS-C mirrorless and beat them on build, speed, and every other area usability area with ease. What it boils down to for me is..Olympus E-M1 or Full Frame? The answer for me is BOTH. One all out IQ monster and one usability and IQ monster. :)<br /><br />Also, let us not forget the lenses. Micro 4/3 has some of the best lenses made for any system, period. There are many highly recommended jewels in the lineup.  At the end of the day this camera gets my highest recommendation. Buy the E-M1 and a couple of nice fast primes and go out and use it and it will be hard to put it down. The Olympus E-M1 has the charm, the soul and the goods to Be my pick for Camera of the Year 2013. Not sure if it will as I hear Sony has something on the way but as it stands now, the E-M1 is at the top of the list. :)<br /><br />As of this writing (October 12th 2013) I can say that for me, the Olympus E-M1 is the best Mirrorless camera on the market today when looking at the 'Whole Picture' of cost, size, build, speed, toughness, EVF, performance, features and lenses available. No one else even comes close and I should know, I have used EVERYTHING out there. Well done Olympus, you have indeed created a mirrorless masterpiece!<br /><br />Which would I take?<br /><br />Panasonic GX7 or E-M1: E-M1 no contest.<br /><br />E-M1 or Fuji X Body: E-M1 no contest.<br /><br />E-M1 or new rumored Sony Full Frame: BOTH, one for the Full Frame IQ and look and one for all that I have raved about.<br /><br />E-M1 or NEX-6: E-M1 due to the lenses and speed and build and IQ.<br /><br />E-M1 or Fuji X100s: Close, but for me, E-M1<br /><br />E-M1 or Pentax K3? The new Pentax looks amazing on Paper, but is still a DSLR. I can not say until I test the K3 :)<br /><br />E-M1 or Leica M: Two different cameras for different audiences. End of story, so BOTH :)"

I used to be a Nikon guy with D300. i bought D300 for better quality from my friend but hated the size. I wanted a smaller size camera with DSLR quality. I purchased Nikon 1 series camera but was never satisfied with the image quality. I was waiting for one of the new Nikon 1 series which kept getting delayed so i thought to try out Olympus OMD EM5. it was an expensive camera and i never tried Olympus before, i thought it was some cheap company since you never see in Bestbuy and all Anyway, the reviews were so good for EM5 that i thought, i would try it out from Amazon since Amazon's return policy is awesome and worst case scenario, i can always return it. i also purchased 45mm F1.8 lens since it was cheap and had very good reviews. When i got the EM5,i took 3 pictures of my daughter in the night and I couldn't believe what i saw. The pictures were sharp, bokeh was amazing (45mm f1.8) and the pictures were better than my D300. it just became better when i realized how awesome the stabilization was specially in videos. My videos were smooth, not jerky.<br /><br />So, when OMD EM1 came, i purchased it immediately. EM1 - this is the next generation of OMD EM5. It's even better than EM5 (EM5 looks better).<br /><br />Pros -<br />1) Image Stabilization on the sensor - If you have never tried Olympus with 5 axis image stabilization, you have no idea how good and important this is. Period. I can never think about taking a picture of my daughter in the room light without some flash ot tripod with D300. With OMD, i hardly ever use flash with EM5 or EM1. There is no lens stabilization by any other company which even comes near and here is the best part, it works on video too. So, your video looks smooth.<br /><br />2) M43 lens are not only awesome, they are cheap - With Nikon, a good quality lens were atleast $1000 or more. Just buy Olympus 45mm f1.8 for $279 refurbished or buy Olympus 25mm F1.8 for $319 refurbished or Panasonic 25mm F1.4 for $529 new. Not only you can buy these high quality lens, you will be blown away by the image quality they produce + bokeh is awesome.<br /><br />3) Size - this was also big for me. There were times, i just didn't feel like carrying around my DSLR. t was big bulky and the lenses were bulky too. M43 lens are much smaller and light. in the winter, i can carry a pancake on EM5 in my jacket pocket. Try that with DSLR.<br /><br />4) image quality - EM1 and even EM5 produces better quality than D300.<br /><br />5) Olympus colors - This is something you have to try. The colors, skin tones with olympus camera are better. BTW, the auto white balance works way better than Nikon if i remember.<br /><br />Cons -<br />1) Video - If you want video, you are better off with Panasonic bodies. Specially in high motion in day light when i'm taking video of my kids, the fast action shows pixilation. I wish Olympus provides better video codec.<br /><br />I would say unless you are carry fullframe Canon or Leica, try Olympus. You would be impressed by the quality."

A leap above my GF1/GH2 and slightly better than my NEX 6 in still pictures.  Love how customizable the buttons are.  It is a little intimidating to operate for the first time.  Just understand that the controls are meant to be accessed by buttons and not by menus, then it becomes second nature.  EVF is the best I have seen and I thought the NEX 6 had a good one.  It is so good in detail that I rely less on focus peaking.  Nevertheless, focus peaking implementation is even better than the NEX 6 as it gives you a visual impression of where the focus point is in terms of distance.  The NEX 6 is a little generous on highlighting the range of what is in focus.  One surprise is the EM1's focus peaking does not work on adapted lenses.  That was not clear on the advertising.<br /><br />Bought this camera for the image quality, the EVF and the image stabilization.  Movies?  The movie mode is not the best compared to Lumix but it is not as bad as some reviews portray it to be.  Imagine taking reasonably nice movies with no tripod, with the ability to punch in at 2x at a flick of a button - stabilized.<br /><br />Only disappointment is the auto-focus tends to hunt.  Maybe it was my lenses.  Using the same lenses on my Lumix, I felt they were faster with less hunting."

It's remarkably durable, comfortable, and versatile. I particularly like that it is light and small enough to easily travel with, especially with light, quality primes (the 25mm and 45mm Olympus lenses in my case), and it's still comparatively compact even with the excellent 12-40/2.8 Pro. The image quality is very good, and I found autofocus fast and reliable for most subjects (very fast-moving objects in the distance can be a challenge but everything short of that is great). The camera is highly customizable, which means it's easy to avoid delving into menus once it's set up. I thought about getting an excellent DSLR like a 70D or D7100, which certainly have some advantages, but the combination of image quality with lens/body size was a winner."

The limitation I ran into with this camera was with long exposure photography. I won't go into the details, but the quality of this type image couldn't touch what I can get from my Nikon D7100. Not even close. Without long exposure NR on the images were terribly noisy and unusable. With long exposure NR on it's just too time consuming...and the photos were also too noisy. Long story short, if you want to use this for everything other than long exposure stuff it's pretty great.

Sorry to say that I don't have ...,"Excellent camera.  Sorry to say that I don't have any Olympus lenses, so I have been using it with my Panasonic lenses.  It works just fine with those. My main reason for getting it was because of the in-body image stabilization.  I own several Canon FD lenses and Canon rangefinder lenses that I wanted to make use of.  The in-body image stabilization works quite well with these lenses.  Only quirk with so-called &#34;legacy&#34; glass is that the Olympus doesn't have a &#34;shoot without lens&#34; setting like the Panasonic cameras do.  I found that instead of setting the mode dial to &#34;A&#34; like you would on a Panasonic GH2, you need to set it to &#34;P&#34; to get the exposure compensation dial to work.  Then it behaves just like it should, by changing the shutter speeds, just as it would on the &#34;A&#34; setting with native lenses."

Olympus,Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mirrorless Camera with Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm f/2.8 PRO Lens,20140626,B00IZKTNJ6,4,1,6,"on June 26, 2014",ANONYMOUS,Almost,"(Jun 26)<br />I have two E-M5s and I decided to buy the E-M1 for the ergonomics. The slightly bigger body is just the right size for me. However, for how I use a camera, the E-M1 has a couple of issues (that I have found so far). The most annoying is the shutter release. The tactile feel of the buttons on the E-M1 is superior to the E-M5 except the shutter release. It has no feel at all. The E-M5 has a nice two stage shutter release. On the E-M1, it is almost impossible to half press without snapping a photo. This is really annoying. I mean really annoying.<br /><br />The second issue is the magnification for manual focus. I do a lot of photography with the 50mm f2 macro (legacy lens and thus manual focus). On the E-M5, the camera reverts to full view when the shutter release is half pressed. On the E-M1 it does not. This is a minor (and subjective) annoyance.<br /><br />(Jul 2)<br />After spending some time with the 12-40 zoom, I can say that with auto focus (m.zuiko, I haven't and probably won't use standard 4/3rds lenses), the E-M1 handles much better than with the 50mm F2 macro (legacy lens) and better than the E-M5 (actually the E-M5 with the 12-40 is too cramped, I have an RRS L-bracket and mini-grip in my E-M5s and my knuckles scrap the lens barrel which is a bit abrasive). I still find manual focus with the 12-40 unpleasant to use. When the focus ring is snapped into manual focus, the view finder will magnify momentarily, too momentarily for me. This is a minor issue and I have the Fn1 button set to magnify, but it would be nice if the auto magnify would persist and revert to full view on a half press (they could make this user configurable).<br /><br />(Jul 8)<br />I spent several hours with the E-M1 yesterday doing what I do the most, close focus flower photo (here is a link stephancrandall.com. The latest E-M1 images will not be posted for a while). I found no new issues with the E-M1. I did find some value in the persistence of magnification for manual focus. When shooting at distances of 10 to 15 in. from the sensor, the depth of field is thin (at f8 the DOF is accepted to be ~4-6mm, but then DOF is subjective as the nodal point is not a range). I often stack images to create a final image with a deeper DOF. The persistent magnification makes it easier to perceive what appears in focus as I build each slice. Additionally, in theory at least, the higher resolution viewfinder of the E-M1 vs. the E-M5 should enhance your perception of acceptable blur.<br /><br />The shutter release, I still feel, is less than optimal for manual focus.<br /><br />Today, I received an L-bracket for the E-M1. I have RRS L-brackets on the E-M5s but RRS was out of stock for E-M1 L-brackets so I bought a cheaper foreign one. I was happily surprised by the quality. It is almost as nice as the RRS (it is missing little things like centerline marks) but you can open the cover to the multi-connector with the L-bracket in place."

However!,"This camera with 12-40 2.8 pro lens has taken me away from my DSLR gear completely.  Before you buy this camera you really have to ask your self what you are buying it for.<br /><br />If you are looking for portability, pro-built body, weather sealed and near equivalent customizable buttons to a professional DSLR then this is for you. Its a camera built for on the go snap shots with high end pro features.<br /><br />For me as soon as mine arrived and I held it in my hands I knew that this was &#34;it.&#34;  I've taken this camera everywhere I've gone to nearly every day after work.  So many people out there buy cameras for the wrong reasons or reasons to fill as if something is missing.  Cameras are made to take images regardless what kind or generation of gear you have. Its all about the image, fulfillment and enjoyment of taking photos.  Because you have to be honest, why bring a camera when you don't feel like even taking pictures with it.<br /><br />Coming from DSLR (which by the way I will never take out anymore unless its indoor events) I take this camera along with the lens 12-40 2.8 pro 99.9% of the time.  Its so functional in nearly every scenario except sports and indoor low lights that I find it hard to justify bringing anything else.  The 5 axis stabilization is insane!  I mean really INSANE.  I can't begin to even describe its performance.  I could take shots in a moving car bouncing up and down and snap away at a cyclist as I pass by and still produce tack sharp image.  I've taken indoor low light shoots at around 1/5sec hand held and come up with impressive usable images.<br /><br />If you're looking for a pro grade camera and lens to take out for a long walk this is a perfect combination."

Most recently I used an Olympus E-30 and prior to that an E-500.  Both cameras made beautiful daylight pictures, but struggled at night or in low light with an iso over 400.  But now.... I can go up to 8000 iso easily without having significant noise.  I can take great pics in low light with short shutter speeds.  Plus I can use my inventory of Zuiko 4/3 lenses.  This is the best of both worlds until Olympus really replaces its pro line lenses with m4/3 equivalents.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Battery life is 1//2 of my E-30's so just go ahead and get a second batter with your purchase.<br /> - The included flash will never be used by a serious photographer<br /> - I really miss my swivel screen<br /> - It can do so much it will take a year to learn and use them all, if ever<br /> - Not all that light<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - It makes some great freakin' pictures<br /> - Faster focus than past 4/3 cameras<br /> - Small format and built like a tank<br /> - weather sealing comes in handy.

I previously owned Canon SLRs, but I wanted a high performance camera in a much lighter and smaller package than SLRs, which means I needed a micro Four-thirds mirrorless (mFT) sold by either Olympus or Panasonic.  Yes, there are other mirrorless high performance cameras of similar size and weight, but they only use SLR lenses that are heavy and bulky, unlike mFT lenses.  In contrast, the E-M1 has both camera and lenses that are much lighter and smaller than equivalent featured SLRs.  Note: some SLRs might be almost as small and light as mFT like the E-M1, but only if the SLR is a very slow, featureless, hard-to-see viewfinder, bottom-of-the-line camera that's mounted with a very slow and less durable lens.<br /><br />  Some of the outstanding features of the E-M1 are superfast autofocus, its electronic viewfinder (EVF), and the 5-axis in-body stabilization.  I like the E-M1's EVF much more than the optical viewfinders from the SLR cameras I owned before.  For instance, when lighting is not bright, you can actually see better through an EVF than an optical viewer that can't brighten the view like an EVF.  Another reason is that an optical viewer can't show you the effects of your adjustments.  For instance, the optical viewer won't show your white balance or exposure adjustments.  I really like that I see my changes in the viewer.<br /><br />  The in-body stabilizer (called 5-axis IBIS) is far better than cameras without stabilizers.  Which means you need to pay more money for each lens to have its own stabilizers, which also adds extra size and weight.<br />  I'm just giving you a few of the many, many features of this terrific camera.  In sum, you will find that no other camera provides the same level of high level features in a similar size and weight and lenses size and weight.<br /><br />  Lastly, some of you are probably wondering about buying the Olympus E-M5, which I also own.  The E-M5 is also a terrific camera, with a very slight advantage in weight and size.  If you're an advanced photographer who will use telephoto lenses and want a built-in, substantial grip, and you want maximum flexibility in selecting most camera functions from easily accessed buttons, then buy the E-M1.  Also, the E-M1 has improved continuous autofocusing versus the E-M5.<br />Otherwise save some bucks and buy the E-M5.  They both have won several &#34;camera of the year&#34; awards when each was released.<br /><br />  I saved the best for last:  the image quality is outstanding and will allow you to enlarge photographs up to 16&#34;x20&#34; or larger with equal image to most any SLR.  And with the portability of the E-M1, you'll be carrying it with you most all the time, rather than a heavy, bulky SLR that gets left behind.  I have stopped using my Canon SLR since I'm tired of toting it around. The E-M1 matches or exceeds my Canon, so it's a no-brainer to go with the mFT Olympus E-M1.<br />  By the way, for those of you who are sometimes outside on the beach or like to photograph when there's a mist or drizzle in the air, both the E-M1 and E-M5 have fabulous weathersealing from dust and moisture/rain.  This is just another terrific feature that puts the quality of these cameras above any SLR in a similar price category."
Olympus,Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mirrorless Camera with Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm f/2.8 PRO Lens,20131215,B00IZKTNJ6,5,5,5,"on December 15, 2013",ANONYMOUS,An excellent micro-4/3 camera,"I got tired of lugging around a large DSLR with heavy lenses on travel, and this Olympus E-M1 was too hard to resist.  This is a professional grade camera body with excellent feel and just about any kind of adjustment and customization imaginable (expect a steep learning curve).  Image quality is excellent, and while it doesn't quite compete with full frame cameras, it comes close enough, at smaller size and weight, particularly when you include lenses in this comparison (the camera body has a good, solid feel, and isn't particularly light, but micro-4/3 lenses are much smaller and lighter than their full frame DSLR counterparts).  The in-body image stabilization (IBIS) works great, for all lenses including manual ones (you have to tell the camera the approximate focal length, but that's easily done).  Compared to my full frame DSLR, this Olympus shows more grain at high ISO settings (1600 and higher), but one can use lower ISO thanks to very effective IBIS (using longer exposures) or very fast lenses (as fast as f/0.95 -- which enables ISO 200 where ISO 1600 might have been required at f/2.8).  This model is a bit more expensive than its predecessor E-M5, but it offers so many refinements in body design and controls that I could justify the price difference.  Coupled with the new Olympus 12-40/2.8 zoom, it covers just about any photo situation; and there are plenty of other excellent lenses available for specific purposes."

I have an Olympus e-510 that was showing its age and this past summer I acquired a Nikon D7100 in the kit 2 lens package.  Compared to the e-510, the Nikon was big and heavy (my old camera bag wasn't big enough for the Nikon gear - I was surprised by just how much larger the D7100 was). The D7100 had nice features that my e-510 was lacking, but in the end, the image quality just didn't impress me. Plus, the thing was really heavy!  I took it on a photography weekend workshop and by the end of the weekend I was wishing for my e-510.  I ended up returning the Nikon - for the price, size, and weight, it just didn't seem worth it.<br /><br />Then the OM-D E-M1 was introduced and I decided to take the plunge again. This time, I am very happy.  The image quality is excellent, the camera is FAST, and I love the size and feel of it.  I'm still using all of my old four-thirds lenses, but I think I'll be buying some micro FT lenses as soon as I can afford it!<br /><br />My biggest concern about moving to this camera was the EVF.  I've used Sony cameras with an EVF and was left very unimpressed, so I was cautious.  I went to the camera store to try it out in person and I was impressed.  Now that I've had it for a month, I love it!  Given a choice between the two, I'm not even sure I would choose the optical now.<br /><br />So much about cameras is personal.  How it feels in your hands can't be overlooked, and it really can't be objectively rated.  I love mine, and if you're curious, I would recommend going to your local camera store and trying it."

I ended up having to order a new camera--which I'm still waiting on.  The Stylus Tough 6000 takes good pictures, but there is a long delay from when you push the button to when the photo is taken.  During photo ops I always had complaints about that.  I would recommend this product (in fact, the camera that I ordered is the upgraded version); however, I would recommend proper care for the camera, as it isn't as durable as the manufactorers would claim.  Since most places aren't as dusty as Afghanistan, I would say that the only inconvient feature is the delay when you're taking pictures.  For those troops who are deploying, don't carry the thing around in your cargo pocket like I did. I thought the microfiber pouch I kept it in would protect it, but it didn't.  Invest in a pelican case and ignore the fact that it's 'dust proof,' because moon dust will still get inside.  All around, it's a great camera and certainly more durable than most.",

I've taken maybe 60 photos with it even though I'm an avid photographer. The picture quality is so bad I rarely bring it out. This camera will take good pictures in bright sunlight outdoors ONLY! I had to use it to take a picture of a hand yesterday and the flash kept coming on in iAUTO mode. Of the 3 pictures, 1 was blown out by the flash, 1 was out of focus, the the third was mediocre with poor detail. Most of the shots I've taken with it under less than ideal lighting (outdoors and bright sun) have come out inferior. All indoor shots are inferior. The software just isn't working here. It needs a lot more tuning, but Olympus has never updated the firmware.<br /><br />Another thing that's happened a lot is that the camera will randomly switch from using the data card to using the internal memory. So after a few shots it's full and I have to pull the card out and reinsert it to get it working again. I am using a 4GB Transcend microSD card with the XD card adapter supplied with the camera. I'm looking into buying a 2GB XD card now to see if that will fix the issue. I couldn't find any XD cards larger than 2GB. Very odd since I have a 16GB SD card in my other camera.<br /><br />The reason I got this camera in the first place was because I've drowned 2 others in the river fishing. So for showing that humongous fish you've caught, in which case capturing you and the fish is more important than the actual picture quality, this camera will suffice. It won't short out in the water and won't die when you drop it. But if you want pictures to print or post on Flickr, this is not it. My other camera is a Lumix LX3, my pride and joy. Comparing the 2 would be like comparing a Yugo with Lamborghini. Yugos were poorly designed and built cars from the 80s for you kids."

It has  been OK in taking medium-quality point-and-click shots similar to what one gets with a smartphone (a little better). The menus are not that straightforward, which means I usually just defaulted to the simplest because it took too long to figure out what the different options were (sometimes trying to make things idiot-proof by using pictures instead of words backfires). The waterproof aspect has always worked for me. I never took it deeper than 10 feet (maybe 5) and it never leaked.<br /><br />However, the reason it is destined for the trashheap is that the shockproofness is not as advertised. This fell from the height of my hip, so well under the supposed 5 feet (no, I am not ten feet tall), and half the distance was through water, which should slow the fall and thus minimize the impact, ultimately landing on rock under water. The camera completely shattered internally (the viewscreen inside the outermost piece of glass looks like a spiderweb of cracks), and I can not see anything in it anymore. The metal lens cover stopped retracting, though I eventually poked and prodded that enough to get it to work again, but I still can't see anything on the screen. FWIW, it still takes pictures and they come out fine; it's just that you don't know what you're taking a picture of. Point it in the general direction of your subject, and maybe you'll get a picture of what you want. And, of course, you can't see any of the menus, so changing any settings is a no-go.<br /><br />Time to research a newer and better option for tough point-and-shoot camera."

I bought this camera after doing a lot of research, and knowing what the reviews were.<br /><br />The picture quality with this camera is beautiful. Some are saying that the photos are grainy, and yes, they are when you use it on out of the box settings. It happened to me and I was very discouraged, but I played around with it, and now the quality is amazing! I set my image quality compression on 'fine', and that solved the problem.<br /><br />The camera comes with specific instructions on underwater usage. I have not tried it yet, but the instructions are very simple and easy to remember. The key is to keep the lens clean at all times, and to thoroughly clean the camera and lens after outings. This can be done by running the lens, open, under a stream of water, and submerging the entire camera for about 10 minutes. If you clean the lens without water, only use a lint free cloth, or lens pen.<br /><br />Since this camera is freeze proof (to 14F), I took it out on a lake with me today and took a lot of pictures. I gave the camera a good workout, and it did a great job. It didn't freeze up or stall at all. The temperature outside was around 25F. I also took a picture of a fish that was swimming by a FishTV underwater camera, and the Olympus captured the fish perfectly.<br /><br />The package included with the camera has the Olympus Master 2, which is the editing program for your pictures. This program has a ton of different things you can do to your photos. I had a Kodak before this, and it's editing program was no where near as large as the Master 2.<br /><br />Yes, this camera does have slow shutter speed. That bothered me at first, but after seeing what this camera can really do, I'll take the slow shutter speed. It does take about 4 seconds after pressing the button to take the photo.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend this camera. If you take the time to play around with it and learn the features, I think you'll be very happy."

Simply, with this camera you can't set these settings; either you stick with the iAuto option or try to get 'the best from it' using the SCN option... but none of them really work. Apparently Olympus thought the camera might know better what kind of picture you want to take better than you do.<br /><br />People might say 'get yourself a SLR'... but no, it's not necessary to buy one of those cameras.

I bought this for $109 I think it was on sale, as it went up to $150 and now it is $190+.

I love this camera after testing it in a real world environment. For some samples on Facebook go to (search on) Bradley Creek, Mills River, NC Facebook page and see the four videos I shot. These videos demonstrate 24x zoom and effective dual image stabilization while walking. Note the continued low exposure. Many have complained about the camera overexposing on Auto settings. Knowing this, you should use the &#34;P&#34; setting and drop the exposure back to -0.3 to -1.0. The LCD screen on my SZ-16 was set dead center for brightness and I found this setting to accurately view the conditions representative for how the picture or video would turn out. I needed a camera at or near the quality of our 24 Megapixel Nikon D5300 for shooting a commercial video. I didn't want to haul around the Nikon in the North Carolina jungle and run the risk of dropping it in the dozens of river crossings and mid-river tripod video shoots. While stationary the camera generally locks to a target in 1 second. While walking the auto-focus wanders with constant surrounding object changes and updates as one proceeds through the thicket. In the Facebook videos at Bradley Creek you will see individual pine needles on rocks 300 feet away at 24x zoom. You can also make out individual pebbles while panning the river bed and rocks with moss. And, keep in mind that the pictures and video are second generation compression removed from the original versions. Facebook does not do a great job of compression regarding videos. Make sure you view all pictures and video in HD mode full screen. I also purchased and satisfied with &#34;2-Pack LI-50B High-Capacity Replacement Batteries with Rapid Travel Charger for Olympus SH-25MR SP-720UZ SP-800UZ SP-810UZ SZ-31MR - UltraPro BONUS INCLUDED: Camera Cleaning Kit, Camera Screen Protector, Mini Travel Tripod&#34;, and, &#34;Transcend 32 GB High Speed Class 10 UHS Flash Memory Card Up to 90 MB/s TS32GSDHC10U1E&#34; in the SZ-16 but also serving as backup memory should the Nikon's' memory chip fail, and, &#34;Co2Crea(TM) Black Semi-Hard EVA Digital Camera Case Bag Cover for Olympus SZ-16/15/14/12/11/10 XZ10 TG-2 iHS SZ30MR SZ31MR with Colorful Neck Strap with tripod mount screw&#34;.

I was a little iffy purchasing this &#34;older model&#34; when the new one was already out. But I'm SO glad I did. I found a great deal and so far it's been able to capture so many more pictures that my phone and (really) older point and shoot couldn't seem to ever capture clearly. With kids running around I often had to just keep taking multiple pictures in the hopes of getting a non-blurry shot. This camera captures that shot and works really well even in low lighting. The zoom is pretty impressive - a little grainy when I zoom all the way, but overall it's a quality zoom. I love the look of the camera with the pearly white, and I really enjoy holding it in my hand with the edge that fits in my palm. GREAT camera and I highly recommend it!

I use this camera primarily for business, and I need to be able to get really good macro shots for detail, and this thing has an amazing macro feature. You can see tiny details, and with the stabilization the focus on these details is great. I also find it works well in mediocre lighting conditions.

I hike daily in the mountains and take a minimum of 40 pictures every day from wild flowers to action shoots of wildlife, and the results are amazing. A large DSLR camera would be just too large and cumbersome to carry, and the SZ-16 fits in my coat pocket comfortably. Shooting on automatic gives you fantastic images whether you are shooting macro or telephoto.  By experimenting with the different setting you can get very close to professional results. The image stabilization feature is somewhat loud when taking 1080 video but when shooting long telephotos it does an amazing job. Most low light conditions are handled automatically and I very rarely ever use the manual pop up flash. The camera is that smart.  I suggest purchasing an additional battery and plug in charger so you always have a backup.  Our friends look at these images and ask what kind of DSLR camera I bought. I have four friends who have purchased this camera after seeing our results and they are all thrilled with the camera. It seems that Olympus is going backwards on the new model camera. I have friends with the newer model and they get nowhere near the results we get with our SZ-16. We highly recommend this great little camera."

It's not uncommon for me to take 150 pictures a day, six days a week. I have owned four different models of the Panasonic Lumix cameras with optical zooms from 12X to the latest 20X. The Panasonic takes good pictures, however, after about six months of use, all of the cameras had issues focusing when zooming past 12X. Two have gone back for repair and were not much better when returned. I switched to the Olympus for the zoom and price point. This has been a great camera. The zoom and focus works flawlessly, all the way out to 24X. I have not had one issue with focusing and the pictures are very clear. I estimate I have 2,000 pictures on this camera so far without a issue.  If you are looking for a good, affordable point and shoot camera, give this camera a look. I don't think you will be disappointed. Last thing, pick up any other point and shoot camera and hold them like you were going to take a picture. They are terrible, nothing to hold onto. Then pick up this camera, it's easy to hold, point and shoot. Enough said. By the camera, you'll like it."

There are many photo/video presets that you can choose - from 'Incandescent' to 'landscape', all the way to 'night portrait' and 'sport' - There are settings to capture the most perfect images for any scene you may come across. The only reason I gave this camera four stars, instead of five, is because the camera doesn't shoot RAW files (which are better quality for editing purposes).

I took pictures at an aquarium with my old one and this one and the ones taken with this camera are much sharper. It was a different aquarium so one may be better lit. The video is easy to access when you finally remember you just push the red dot. The panorama is easy and takes wonderful pictures. It is very small for all its features and my pictures usually come out very nice, better than with the old ones when the subject is moving. I take a lot of pictures of animals. I've had good experiences with Olympus in the past, and very bad experiences with a couple of other brands so I didn't really consider anything else. I kept coming back to this one since it has such a good zoom in a small package."

There is one major button on the back of the camera, and you have to decide to press it right, left, up, down center, and a few other ways depending on what you want to do.  The arrows are hard to see, very tiny, and just sort of blend in with the color of the button itself, it would be much easier to have more clear markings.

I have had to edit every landscape photo I have taken with this camera, just to get it to look decent.<br /><br />Also, I dropped the camera the other day on a hike, from a height of only about two feet, and it fell on the earth, not on rocks or anything. It now does not retract the lens cover when turned on, I have to manually push it with something. My old Canon Powershot A640 has been dropped probably 75 times in the many years I have owned it and it still works, just the photos are a little grainy (probably from being dropped too often!)

Much better then it's Fuji counterparts.  Love the ability to take movies and stills at the same time.  Recently tried using the special shooting features and found some of them really cool (like mirror image and sparkle).  A go pro might work better for extreme situations or slapping onto your face, but for all around general family pictures at beach, pool, or anywhere water may be it is the best for the buck.  For general shooting it is at least a match for its price point except for zoom ability."

I Will never buy Olympus again.,"Not Durable and terrible customer support. Camera takes O.K. pictures but be warned. I didn't use it much and it broke after only 14 months of ownership. Would take only three pictures with any brand new fully charged battery then light would blink and screen would go go black.If you search the Internet you will find others with this exact same problem. I never even used this in water. Had three older Olympus cameras over the years that were great and lasted well. This one visibly lower quality out of the box.The Worst part is that Olympus does not stand behind product at all and refers you to a generic call center somewhere whee you can't understand what the operators are saying. They are charging me more than half the cost of new to get it working again. When it breaks again, it goes straight in the trash can and I will buy another brand. Don't support this business. Almost anywhere would treat you better and the new products are Junk."

Well, decided I needed a newer camera commensurate with my lifestyle.  The Olympus Tough Series is that.  The TG-830 is waterproof, shockproof, and freeze-proof.  And yes, I have tested all three.  In the past year, it's been fishing in Canada (and dropped in the Maramichi River), snorkling off the coast of Cozumel (great pics), and mountain biking in below freezing Missouri (great action video), and I've had zero problems.  It's significantly smaller than my old Canon (totally different cameras of course) and lighter.  Coupled with its toughness, I can carry it in my pocket when outdoors at all times...canoeing, hiking, fishing, biking, etc...and it's at the ready.  Just went canoeing a few weeks ago, and had in a zip pocket in my shorts while fording a stream.  No worries.  Most pic's are great, as are the video's.  Only knocks are the limited zoom (but to be expected with a fixed lens) and an annoying clicking sound when videoing.  Other than that, I love it..."

But it gives the camera less utility in the rain and for activities such as kayaking because you are more likely to have water spots on the lens which will show up in pictures.

I was leery of buying any underwater camera because all of the available models have at least one review that claims that it leaks water, and that the companies do not support the product.  I chose this one because of the number of features, including waterproof, shockproof, GPS, panorama mode, and HD video for the price of $199. The camera worked very well for the intended purposes.  We used it in the pool, in the ocean, dropped it in the sand, and onto the tile floor, all without any damage at all.  The camera did NOT leak any water despite taking over 700 pictures while wet.  We followed the directions to clean it after using it in the ocean, and then towel dried and air dried prior to opening the door to charge the battery.<br /><br />Our other Not-Water-Proof Camera is the Cannon PowerShot S110 (point and shoot model - not an SLR).  When comparing the two cameras, the Cannon definitely takes sharper pictures in all light conditions, but especially low light.  The Olympus can have some minor graininess when viewed at full resolution on our 24-inch Apple monitor, but it is very subtle.  I think the pictures of my daughter jumping into the pool looked great,  had good color and captured the memories that I was after.  I'm not sure that I would want this as my only camera, but I don't think it is intended for that purpose.  It really is made to use in the cold, in the water, and when you might drop it - all times when you would never bring your other camera.<br /><br />Overall, I am really happy that I bought this.  The pictures are great, the price is very reasonable for all of the features, and it captured great memories from the trip.  I would recommend you consider this camera if you are looking for a camera in this 'tough', waterproof category."

The view screen has a very short &#34;on&#34; period after turning the camera on. I find it goes dark while I'm trying to compose a picture, which is very aggravating. I found the control option that allows the screen to stay on constantly, but I'd rather be able to control the &#34;on&#34; duration rather than have the equivalent of &#34;off&#34; and &#34;on&#34;. Based on what I paid for the camera, the value is excellent."

Digital Zoom and Super-Res Zoom are greyed out.  So if using the camera in AUTO, no digi zoom for you and you are stuck with 5x.<br /><br />The other thing that I did not know before buying is that the movies are in MOV format.

Let me tell you why...","I must say this line of cameras are the best I've ever owned, hands down. I had the first model that came out to go to Costa Rica with. Survived being dropped, stepped on, sat on, cold weather, hot weather, pools, and oceans. After 4 years, I had dropped the camera while one of the little doors was open and it bent the door. It still worked, so I took it scuba diving in Bali and after about an hour in the water the camera died. I took it to the surface only to find it flushed with water - gutted. I dried it out in rice for several days, and although it would turn on again it was never the same. Bought the new model and haven't looked back. I've used it all over the world and in several pools/oceans/rivers and has still provided like my old model :).<br /><br />One more story that will build your confidence on this product:<br /><br />I had bought my brother one for his birthday. He studies fish and is an outdoorsman to the max, so he's in and around rivers and rocky terrain all the time. One day he had dropped his camera in the river, and because it was a deep and quick moving river, they couldn't find it. Two years later, they were diving the same river and actually found the camera. The camera still worked!!! It took great photos, all seals were still in tact and working great, and the only &#34;problem&#34; with the camera was that the blue color had worn off in some areas. I could not believe that thing survived for 2 YEARS! I would highly recommend these Tough Cameras to anyone who may be looking for an outdoor camera, a diver/snorkeler, a snow border, or a person that tends to be hard on products ;)"

It still is not as clear as my wife's SLR with fancy lenses, but it fits in my pocket and turns on fast (2 seconds) to take candid shots on the fly.<br /><br />Here's a few tips for the 'point and shoot' folks who don't want to mess with camera settings too much.<br /><br />1) use a decent size SD card. 4Gb stores about 400 pictures at the highest setting, or 16 min. of video at the highest setting<br />2) use the lowest ISO=100 setting (in mode='P'), and everything else on AUTO for best clarity. this camera takes great pics with ISO 100 (see attached: bird was at full 24x zoom, dog was inside w/ flash).<br />3) when ISO was not fixed at 100, my video would go from bright to dark and back again. Setting the ISO=100 helped that a great deal."

I bought this camera because I wanted a bit more zoom than my warhorse Stylus 810 has, so that I have a &#34;pocket&#34; camera to take into concerts. I knew that this wasn't going to be a good experience from the minute I took this camera out of the box. Rather than having something that FEELS solid, this feels cheap and is made of light weight plastic.<br /><br />Olympus removed some of the traditional settings, such as bird watching, so you have to fumble around to figure out what's what. But!! that's ONLY after you make your way through a maze of what's not identified as a menu--the actual menu also has removed traditional functionality that's on other models, so you have to figure out where they've put those functions, too!<br /><br />To have the untrained user have to set their own white balance? Very poor!<br /><br />The latch on the bottom where the battery and memory card are both in the same slot feels like it could break at any time.<br /><br />The battery charger is doomed to die as it's a USB cord that can plug into device that you plug into a wall--that same cord is what you'll also use to download pictures using their crappy software that doesn't recognize the device until you unplug and replug several times. These two should be separated for the sake of the USB will wear out and need to be replaced--I can see already that this will run a small fortune to replace from the way Olympus has been heading!<br /><br />The &#34;shooting screen&#34; is useless in the sun, even with sun glasses! (OLYMPUS BRING BACK Eye viewers! They are the ONLY way people can actually SEE what they're shooting!!! These screens are a joke!!)<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the software that comes with this! They're far more interested in getting you to race off to some online company to upload and buy your pictures than allowing you access to them and editing them!<br /><br />The quality of pictures is the real disappointment. This isn't what I expect from Olympus! There's are massive yellow and green tinges in the pictures, not the rich blues and reds that I've come to expect!<br /><br />This was $160 wasted. Since I can't return it, I'll probably donate it to Goodwill, as this camera is such a piece of junk I wouldn't want a friend or family member to own it!"

Most of them were really good so I decided to try it.<br />16 megapixel and 24x optical zoom.<br /><br />Now I am not a camera expert, but I do feel like I can use a camera reasonably well and I am used to using different settings. I can use a camera beyond just point and shoot.<br /><br />The first pictures I took were in my livingroom. I wasn't impressed with the focus and lighting. So I tried using flash, no flash, indoor setting, auto setting . .  hmmm<br /><br />Well, it was time to go to my daughter's school concert. At the school the kids faces all turned out yellow, I had one picture turn out and I don't know why that one did. (I even brought it home and took the sd card out to look at it on my computer to see if it was just the camera display, nope the pics were terrible).<br /><br />Then I tried to video. The faces were yellow on the video too. But even worse than that, if that's possible, there is NO stabilization!!!!<br />Also, when you zoom in and out it does not stay focused and has to re-adjust the focus constantly! So in the middle on the video there is blurry spots where the camera was refocusing. Sometimes school events are hard to take pictures at due to the lighting (it was in the gym & I was in the front row)<br />So I tried again at home. I had my daughter stand by her granddad. He turned out clear her face was blurry. I manually adjusted the exposure and ISO bypassing all the presets. That sort of helped.<br /><br />I did not try the camera outdoors. I know some cameras that don't do well indoors do great outside.<br /><br />The next day I reset all the factory settings and tried one last time to take a picture in the kitchen of my daughter, it was so blurry. That was it, packed it up and took it back."

None of my compact camera cases would fit, so I opted for a genuine leather Olympus case which is made for this camera and the price isn't bad considering it's leather - see link below.<br /><br />The build quality is good, except for the plastic tripod mount. Made in Indonesia if that matters.  The zoom motor sounds strong. Image stabilization is excellent.<br /><br />My Sony cameras were always my 'go to' cameras for superb-quality videos....but this Olympus really excels in the video department. It's better than any of my Sony cameras, plus it has high speed video, which in reality becomes slow motion when you play it back. When using this camera (or any camera) in high speed video, there will be no audio. There can't be, it would be like the opposite of the Chipmunks.<br /><br />The battery life is good, considering a touchscreen uses more power. You charge the battery inside the camera.<br /><br />Camera is quick to focus, quick to take the photo, and fast response to take the next unless you're using one of the Magic Filters.  I love the 'fragmented' filter which makes the photo look like you've taken a hundred photos and combined them into one.<br /><br />So like most cameras, there is good and bad to this Olympus. If good macro shots are at the top of your list, I'd choose a different camera. If full manual control is on your list, definitely don't choose this camera; you have only 2 choices, neither one good. If you aren't into macro shots or full manual control, you'd probably like this camera a lot, as the photo quality is mostly excellent, especially landscapes - beautiful!<br /><br />Genuine Olympus Case:&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Leather-Case-for-XZ-1-SH-50/dp/B0051H767W/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Leather Case for XZ-1 & SH-50</a><br />Class 10 SDHC Card:&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Transcend-32-GB-Class-10-SDHC-Flash-Memory-Card-TS32GSDHC10E/dp/B003VNKNF0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS32GSDHC10E)</a>"

After I switched adapters and let the camera charge for over 12 hours, it would not power up. It would beep, blink a light, make a noise and even acted like it was going to turn on but it did not. Finally, after 30-40 tries the camera powered up and showed a full battery on the screen. However, the flash worked only a couple of times and then it completely stopped working again when I unplugged the USB. Now there was nothing, no beep, no little flash of light and no noise. I am returning this piece of junk first thing Monday."
Olympus,Olympus Stylus SH-50 iHS Digital Camera with 24x Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Silver) (Old Model),20140416,B00DHEP8J4,5,4,4,"on April 16, 2014",ANONYMOUS,Great little point-and-shoot camera,"This pocket-sized camera has some features that set it apart from the usual point-and-shoot digital cameras. Even if you use a Digital SLR (interchangeable lens camera), often a small point-and-shoot is handy for backup, for carrying when you don't want a bulky camera, or just for people who simply want a digital camera that takes stills and videos but isn't going to set you back five hundred bucks or more. I can say that this camera is probably going to work for most people, and even work for the more serious photographer who wants a quick-shoot camera.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />24X zoom is HUGE. You can zoom in from a great distance and take close-in shots for sports, outdoor nature photography or for tight framing of portraits (a medium telephoto is a great way to take a face picture sometimes.) You zoom by toggling a lever on the top of camera. Easy.<br /><br />Image stabilization in this camera is exceptional. You get three axes of stabilization for stills, plus two more for videos, meaning that you can get sharp results even without a tripod.<br /><br />Full HD Video Recording (1008/60i)<br /><br />Smart Panorama feature to let you take panorama shots (but chews up battery life, beware.)<br /><br />3' Touch Screen. I got used to using a touch screen on my main camera and I find it's the easiest way to change settings. 3 inch is a very good sized view screen.<br /><br />Battery lasts for about 300 shots, pretty good.<br /><br />11 'Magic Filters' These let you convert your images in the camera to artsy shots. You can always do the same thing with your photo editing software, but for people who send their digital camera shots directly to Instagram or Facebook, it can be convenient and fun.<br /><br />Form factor: a bit larger than typical point and shoot. Also, it's made mostly of metal. Has a very sturdy, robust feel. A great camera for backpacking and outdoors.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />A bit grainy at low light setting (ISO 1600)<br /><br />Flash seems a bit weak in very dim light.<br /><br />This camera is bigger and heavier than most point-and-shoot. It is 30% bigger than a Canon Powershot I typically use as a backup camera. (But it also does more.) So, a bit bulkier than typical point-and-shoot cameras, which are often about the size of a pack of cards.<br /><br />No viewfinder (this is now usual in point-and-shoot cameras as it adds cost, and it's not used for videos, so pretty much, viewfinders have gone away. But in bright light, a viewscreen can be hard to see.) A minor point, but realize you may want a screen protector as the viewscreen is how you are going to be framing your shots.<br /><br />The manual settings and some other setting are a combination of dial and touch screen. I got used to touch screen on a Canon DSLR and a touch screen makes settings about as easy as you can get. I found some of the settings not as simple to get to--and the manual is not complete. Some information (such as how to use the Magic art filters) is simply not there. To use the filters, by the way, you set M for Magic BEFORE you take the shot and scroll through which variation (pop art, fragmented, pin hole, dramatic, sparkle, punk, watercolor and the reflection which mirrors your shot on a horizontal axis. This last is great for videos. It's a bit slow to set your filter, but it lets you visualize AS you shoot, not process after shooting and it lets you apply the filter as you shoot video. This is unique to most filters on digital cameras and could be a lot of fun.)<br /><br />Video: very easy to use, high def is an advantage.<br /><br />Software: the software is not very sophisticated. In particular, the video portion is almost useless (you can merge clips, extract a still, export, but very little else.) It's there for users to have something to process photos and videos, but you'll need a lot more than Olympus offers.<br /><br />Manual: Somewhat sketchy on the deeper features. It's a PDF file on the included disk.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />I like it far more than my Canon Powershot. If you can only buy one camera and it needs to be affordable and compact, this one is a great choice and has a lot of features for the price."

I contacted Olympus within three days of receiving the camera and they tell me that the part is no longer available.  So,..... they're still selling a camera (brand new) that they don't make battery chargers for any more???  This is ridiculously hard to believe.  I realize I can buy this part seperately or charge the battery via my computer, but come on Olympus...this is very poor customer service.....open a box on a new on and send me the adapter.  Camera, great!  Customer Service, 'Don't count on any!'<br /><br />4/16/2014 Update:  Olympus now sends an email stating that the original email was a mistake and that I should call them at their toll-free number to resolve the issue because 'these types of issues are best solved over the telephone'.  So, I take the time to call them, and re-explain the entire issue, then the person tells me that I should deal with the seller on this issue and then to call them back if the seller doesn't correct the problem.  Wow! Great Customer Service, right?  BUT WAIT:......<br /><br />I then contacted Amazon and they DID take care of the problem.....I LOVE AMAZON!  Thank you Amazon and Mark!<br /><br />Another update to the actual product....I am LOVING this camera.  It has a 'Magic' setting on the dial that adds filters to the photos:  Wide-angle, pin-hole, mirror-image, pop-art, dramatic, etc.  these are fun options!  Also, the 16mp is something I will use to print enlargements of my photos.  The camera is easy to use and the pictures a very sharp."

Nothing that cannot  be easily corrected in Photoshop.<br />Exposure, about the most consistent I have seen in any camera.<br />Resolution, theoretically great, in practice rather poor. Here is where this camera limps notoriously. Olympus chose to apply a very aggressive de-noising algorithm.<br />It is on at all ISO speeds and there is no way to adjust or cut it off. End result, very mushy images when viewed at high resolution; you can forget about printing 16x20s or larger, sorry...<br />Having said that, I must say that the camera still produces pleasant if not perfect images. It might even surprise you occasionally when shooting in low  light.<br />User interface is easy to learn, quick and effective. Lots of features, very decent and usable HDR, panoramas and more.<br />Very limited manual controls but automation is so good that you might not even miss them.<br />Awesome zoom with one glaring shortcoming, light gathering power at the extreme zoom end is outright pitiful, it is so low that the camera has to use very long exposure times even on sunny days. Even the excellent stabilization system cannot cope with it and you are forced to lean against solid structures even in broad sunny daylight if you want reasonably sharp pictures<br />Using the zoom indoors with live subjects; forget it!  Not even on a tripod!<br /><br />Now for the real forte of this camera - Incredible videos, the stabilization system for videos is truly stunning, it is practically like having a &#34;SteadyCam tm&#34; built into the camera (for those who know what a SteadyCam does).<br />On the other hand, the superb stabilization comes at a price, and the price is very, very aggressive cropping, this prevents from taking full advantage of the excellent wide angle capabilities of the lens. Strangely enough, Turning off the stabilization does not prevent cropping, so that's that.<br />Manual controls in video mode are rudimentary, and there is no provision for an external mike. Nonetheless, the built in sound is very acceptable even outdoors (with the wind noise filter on).<br />Thankfully, touch screen focus can be fully enabled during video recording and that kicks it one big notch up making it, in a pinch,  a very viable videographer's tool.<br /><br />Even if the picture quality may not be to your liking, you may still seriously consider this camera for its video capabilities."

The first was Panasonic TZ3 and very recently Sony HX30V. I love those cameras as they are easy to carry in your pocket and quick to use while traveling.<br />This Olympus is a bit larger than the Sony but still small enough to put in your pants pocket. It doesn't feel cheap and plastic. Feels solid and sturdy. The settings are much less complicated than the Sony, and the zoom is better.<br />What stands out is the Optical Image stabilization. I only took still images (not video) but even for a laymen like myself I felt at 48X zoom the camera stable. It was also reflected in the pictures.<br />The colors in my test are very good.<br />They only thing I am not crazy about is that in order to use the flash you must first manually release a switch, so when needed it will flash.<br />There is not GPS tagging, which I miss, and no WI-FI connectivity which I do not feel is useful. And if you insist, you can use Eye-FI SD memory card.<br /><br />So far it looks like a great little camera, solid and practical for a quick use and travel."

Best and most important of all the photos look extremely fine with little noise and the colors seem very accurate. Battery life is plenty long, but I did also purchase a spare. I do wish there were a way to charge the battery outside the camera, but there is a light around the power button to let you know when it is fully charged.

The camera seems to be floating through the air when taking videos while on the move. Another great feature which I like is the ability to just touch the screen on what you want to focus on and take the picture without having to use the shutter button. Pictures and video all are sharp and clear. The 3-axis stabilization when taking pictures also does a great job while the 24x/48x zoom is a lot of range for such a small camera. The camera is very well constructed and has a little weight to it. The only thing I did not like on the camera is the plastic cover over the USB and HDMI connections. A hinged door would be less inclined to be broken. Overall a great little camera.<br /><br />UPDATE: One thing I've found is that it is extremely difficult to hear the sound from video when playing back on the camera. Most cameras have a small hole to allow the sound to exit the case. I have been unable to find any on this camera. I also have an Olympus TG-830 camera and the sound is very easy to hear. This isn't a big problem but could be for those who like to view and listen to videos on the camera.

I use the shutter button almost 100% of the time.

I spent many hours researching cameras and this is the choice that suited me. I wanted more than the average point and shoot so I would get quality photos but I did not want a Digital SLR camera with features I know I would never use. This camera has many options from Automatic to Program to Manual and other useful modes, along with special effects modes. The video is very nice quality also. The camera comes with an instructional CD so you can really learn how to use all of its unique features without feeling overwhelmed. I appreciate the camera's anti-blur technology and this was a big selling point for me. I did buy an extra battery at my local electronics store so I have a back-up when I am traveling and taking a lot of photos. The camera feels substantial (not cheap) but it is small enough to fit into my camera pouch - a perfect size for travel. I chose the black color option and I am very satisfied with the camera's design.

However these sensors despite their smaller size have gotten quite a bit better over the years, especially the processing power attached to them.  This camera mates a super zoom lens 24x zoom (25-600mm equivalent), fast responsive touchscreen, and some amazing image stabilization in a retro looking package.<br /><br />Photo quality: Compared it to our Canon G10, which is an older slightly step up from the point and shoot sensor size, and while the G10 had a small edge, the photos were quite close.  The CMOS sensor on the stylus helps here, since it can get more light into the sensor without noise.  The main difference I noticed between the two cameras was the electronics and other technology utilized.  The Stylus's touchscreen was quick and response, even allowing you to take photos right from the touchscreen.  Also the image stabilization was quite good on the Stylus.<br /><br />However where the Stylus really shines is in video capture, full 1080p, sure it's just resolution, but this camera takes great video at that resolution.  The 5 axis image stabilization is amazing.  You can turn on video, move around and the image just floats, stabilizing in a mind boggling way.  You can also capture stills while shooting video which is great.<br /><br />This is a great point and shoot, comes in quite a bit cheaper than the step up, or going to a micro 4/3's format, while being more portable.  The zoom lens needs quite a bit of light fully extended, but this is almost always the case in these cameras.  The sensor is great, image stabilization especially on video is jaw dropping.  Great little camera."

Olympus,Olympus Stylus SH-50 iHS Digital Camera with 24x Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Silver) (Old Model),20130918,B00DHEP8J4,3,60,71,"on September 18, 2013",ANONYMOUS,"A bit too bulky for me, but not a bad camera","I like the old school look, particularly the pop up flash, but the plastic feels a little cheap. Also, for a point-and-shoot, it's fairly bulky. I couldn't fit it in any of my other point-and-shoot cases. The biggest problem is with how far the lens sticks out, even when fully reclined. It also doesn't use a standard Mini or Micro USB connector. You have to use a special cable by Olympus (provided) to connect the camera to your computer/charger. This means one more miscellaneous cable to keep track of.<br /><br />The controls are simple, but the menu system is a little messy to navigate. The 24x zoom provides excellent reach for distant shots. The macro option was a little disappointing; it forces the lens/zoom at a fixed position so you are stuck using predefined settings. I also had a hard time taking a handheld macro photo that wasn't blurry, even with a fair amount of light on the subject; you pretty much need to use a tripod (or a steady surface). Not so good for moving subjects. However, the camera was able to use autofocus fairly close to the subject, I measured about 1' from the lens, which is about 3' from the camera body/image sensor.<br /><br />There are no aperture and shutter priority modes, but you can somewhat tweak the settings under the manual mode. I'm being generous using the word somewhat. The shutter speeds go from 1/2000 to 15', the ISO from 125 to 6400 (expect lots of noise higher up the scale), but the f/stop for aperture is useless. Instead of moving up and down stops, you get two options depending on the zoom. Zoomed in, you get F3.0 and F8.7. Fully zoomed out you get F6.9 and F20. Nothing in between. And because you can't set the priority mode, changing one value doesn't auto-set the other, so you need to manually tweak each setting. On the positive side, the preview screen does show you approximately what the picture will look like as you are making your adjustments.<br /><br />Overall, the camera feels a little cheap to me and is limited on options (no GPS, for example). It's bulkier than I like a point-and-shoot to be, and 16MP isn't the highest quality you can get for this price range. The best thing this camera provides is the 24x zoom, but for the bulk, I'd rather go with something a little smaller. For example, the Sony DSC-WX300/B is 18.2 MP with a 20x Optical Zoom and is half the size. Not to mention a better build, longer battery life, and a smaller price tag (currently $278.00 on Amazon). Granted, the Sony has even less features than this camera does, such as no macro or manual mode, but it's a lot more compact and easier to carry around. When looking for a camera, it really depends on how you're planning to use it. I like the Sony DSC-WX300/B for quick out-and-about family type shots, the Sony Alpha SLT-A99V for more professional shooting, the Canon EOS Rebel T3i for full control and good quality photos without having to lug around the A99, and the Panasonic Lumix ZS20 for the best overall full control/features on a point-and-shoot. I just don't see where the Olympus Stylus SH-50 iHS fits into my arsenal. That said, if it's your only camera, and you don't do anything overly complicated with it, it's not a bad choice."

I have carried a number of alternatives including the&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Nikon-COOLPIX-P7700-12-2-MP-Digital-Camera-with-7-1x-Optical-Zoom-NIKKOR-ED-Glass-Lens-and-3-inch-Vari-Angle-LCD/dp/B0090SLE30/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Nikon COOLPIX P7700 12.2 MP Digital Camera with 7.1x Optical Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and 3-inch Vari-Angle LCD</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Fujifilm-X20-12-MP-Digital-Camera-with-2-8-Inch-LCD-Silver/dp/B00AV3XH9W/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Fujifilm X20 12 MP Digital Camera with 2.8-Inch LCD (Silver)</a>.  While those are different class cameras and aptly suited as DSLR alternatives in certain situations, I find the SH-50 just as suitable for nearly every situation with limited exceptions.  For example, since the camera does not produce RAW files, in my opinion, camera use is limited to those situations in which you will not seriously post process images.<br /><br />I reviewed this product from the perspective of a typical end-user looking for portability and quality with ease of use. This camera scored high in all areas. It is an advanced level point and shoot camera without question and will perform incredibly well for any end-user seeking high quality images in a convenient package.<br /><br />Product packaging is exceptional with very clear instructions.  As always, I recommend reading the manual- an often overlooked task.  The product build is also exceptional, providing a very solid build quality typical at this price point. In fact, the next jump to build quality in my opinion puts you in the&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Nikon-COOLPIX-P7700-12-2-MP-Digital-Camera-with-7-1x-Optical-Zoom-NIKKOR-ED-Glass-Lens-and-3-inch-Vari-Angle-LCD/dp/B0090SLE30/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Nikon COOLPIX P7700 12.2 MP Digital Camera with 7.1x Optical Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and 3-inch Vari-Angle LCD</a>&nbsp;class, at a much higher price point (though it is expected to drop with the announcement of the&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Nikon-COOLPIX-P7800-12-2-MP-Digital-Camera-with-7-1x-Optical-Zoom-NIKKOR-ED-Glass-Lens-and-3-inch-Vari-Angle-LCD/dp/B00EZAYD4A/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Nikon COOLPIX P7800 12.2 MP Digital Camera with 7.1x Optical Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and 3-inch Vari-Angle LCD</a>. Note, this build quality also increases the size.  Unlike much cheaper options, this camera will not fit into pants pockets.  It is better suited for carrying in a bag or a waist pack. Ergonomic design is well thought out in all aspects and any complaints would really be nitpicking. The rubberized grip on the right side of the camera seriously improves shooting ability through a better grip and a stabilized hold.  The touch screen provides limited value in my opinion, but its nice to see this option finally emerging. I do miss a viewfinder, which I consider critical for serious photography.  However, this camera was not designed or marketed with that intention.<br /><br />One of the most important, yet often overlooked, aspects of consumer cameras is responsiveness; and, specifically three key areas: time to turn on, time to focus and lock, and shutter time. In all three areas, the Olympus exceeded my expectations and I have found it to be nearly as good as my more expensive P7700 in this regard. Even in low light, the Olympus seemed to acquire and lock focus far better than expected.  Keep in mind, for context, I am a full blown pro level DSLR shooter.  This ability to obtain and lock focus means you will likely not miss those important shots of your family in action.<br /><br />The SH-50 provides a decent amount of manual control for the creative types. However, it offers ease of use through fully automatic control with scene detection. However, in automatic mode, I noticed the flash rarely fired.  As a strobist myself, I rarely shoot without flash, even in broad daylight. The camera also offers custom white balance though I imagine most will stick to automatic white balance, which worked very well in my tests.<br /><br />Since this camera, like nearly all at this level, does not offer RAW files, image quality of the produced jpeg out of the camera is critical as most users will not post process.  In this regard, the Olympus is likely best in class. Skin tones were accurately reproduced with decent, yet not over-saturation. The camera shot with minimal noise to ISO 400 but I would never exceed ISO 800 with this camera personally (I am a low ISO shooter by design). But, you can go to ISO 1600 if needed. Exposure and color were incredibly accurate in my tests.  A key thing to keep in mind is the ability of the camera and lens to resolve details at increased zoom lengths (any camera really). In this case, the small sensor with the dense pixel design (16mp on a small sensor) cannot overcome the 24x optical (versus digital) zoom.  Keep that in mind as you zoom in.<br /><br />A final key selling point of this camera is the 25mm wide angle capability.  While I would never shoot portraits at this focal length, the wide angle capability clearly opens up creative options for the user as well as more practical applications such as large group photos.<br /><br />As always, feel free to ask any questions and I will try to respond as quickly as possible.  You will not be disappointed in this camera."

I was attracted by the inclusion of image stabilization as well as picture quality. I was impressed with the quality of the pictures from this camera. I do a lot of Photoshop work and this camera automatically makes pictures that are so sharp and bright it takes all the work out of getting sparkling sharp pictures.<br /><br /> There are also loads of special features which are just plain fun to use such as the mirror image function. You can make  all sorts of freaky  faces of yourself and others.  The image stabilization takes the jerkiness out of pictures especially movies and gives them a smooth floaty appearance,within limits.  About the only decision you have to make is the quality of picture. I set mine on high. Don't try flash with Intelligent Auto. One cool feature is back light control. I often see people lining up their family in front of a landmark with the sun coming from the rear. With ordinary cameras you get bad results but using the HDR back light setting you can get away with it.<br /><br />This is not a pro camera as it only shoots in JPEG although you can use Photoshop on it. You don't get raw images. If viewed at high power some images can be waxy. It uses screen viewing only,no eye piece. Uses touch screen or traditional  button pushing picture taking . I am a touch screen fan. There is no GPS. It will work with wi -fi  but  it requires a special card for this. It works best at lower magnification . It has tremendous optical zoom power but it is really hard to see what you are doing at high power on the touch screen. It could use a two stage zoom feature to make it more controllable when you zoom. The last quarter inch of the zoom lever makes the picture go completely bonkers."

It has a rubberized grip on the front that makes holding the camera easy and the camera feels great in the hand.  The camera's materials are very nice with a metal front plate.  The buttons and dials feel high quality and work smoothly.  It's nicely assembled and feels sturdy.  Size wise it's not going to fit into a jean pocket but will travel well in a jacket pocket or a small bag.  Included with the Olympus is a USB cable that plugs into your computer or the included power adaptor.  The battery charges in camera.  Also included is a stylus to operate the touch screen, but I found the touch screen worked well enough that I didn't need it.<br /><br />The Olympus has lots of features that cater to photographers of every skill set.  For those who prefer to let the camera do all of the work there is an automatic mode, a handful of scene modes, and a few artistic filters (pinhole, fisheye, etc.).  One thing to be aware of is that in automatic mode the camera will rarely fire the flash.  The Olympus would rather keep the shutter speed low.  That may result in blurry photos due to camera and/or subject movement.  To make matters worse, in automatic mode you're only given two choices for the flash, automatic and off, so you can't even force the flash to fire manually.  The solution is to shoot in P mode or the indoor scene mode, where flash fires much more readily.  This is a pretty odd way for the camera to behave, and I think it is the Olympus' biggest flaw.  For those who want more control the camera offers a fully manual mode that lets you choose the aperture (only two available at any given zoom), shutter speed (from 15' - 1/2000), and ISO speed (there is no auto ISO in M mode).  Additionally, there are two presets for custom white balance.  One thing I don't like is that the Olympus does not have a dedicated macro button.  If you want to access the closest shooting range you have to enter the macro scene mode, which is completely automated.<br /><br />Using the Olympus is easy.  The buttons are well laid out, the menu system is simple and easy to understand, and the touch screen is very responsive.  The thing about the touch screen is that it only controls a very limited set of functions.  When taking photos it will let you tap take the photo or just set the focus/exposure.  It works well and responds quickly.  In playback mode you can use the touch screen to go through photos or pan when zoomed into a photo.<br /><br />The Olympus is a very speedy camera.  After you turn it on it is ready to shoot in about 4 seconds.  It focuses at wide angle in about 1 second and the long end in about 2 seconds.  It rarely hunts for focus, even at full telephoto.  Continuous shooting speeds are also great.  When shooting full resolution you are offered a choice of two speeds.  The faster one takes a few photos every second and stops after 17 photos, while the slower speed takes about 1 photo every second and I stopped at 50 photos but the camera could keep shooting.<br /><br />Photo quality of the Olympus is great.  Color, exposure, and focus are perfect about 99% of the time.  Overall, the photos have a very pleasant and appealing look with rich accurate color and nice tonality.  However, the one place where the Olympus falters is with resolving fine detail.  This is a small sensor packed with pixels and in order to combat noise (color speckling) Olympus chooses to blur it away.  Therefore, even at the lowest ISO speeds, details like grass and hair end up looking mushy and indistinct.  I'd consider up to ISO 400 as where you'd want to do most of your shooting, use ISO 800-1600 in a pinch, and stay away from higher sensitivities as photos look less like photos and more like blotchy watercolor paintings.  Still, unless you're making huge prints, or cropping photos dramatically, you probably won't even notice the loss of detail and will be very happy with the photos the Olympus takes.  The image stabilizer is very effective and I was able to take sharp shots at wide angle at 1/5 and at telephoto at 1/250.  Strangely, the stabilizer will sometimes make a loud squeaking/farting noise at full telephoto.  Be careful in a quiet setting as people may think the noise is coming from you!<br /><br />Movies shot with the Olympus are quite nice.  They are full high definition and have stereo sound.  You can use the optical zoom while shooting, but you'll hear the motor on the recording in quiet environments.  The image stabilizer is very effective, and movies are smooth and have little shake.<br /><br />The lens on the Olympus is quite a performer.  Not only does it start at a nice wide angle of 25mm (letting you fit more in the photo), but also the 24x optical zoom lets you get really close without reduction in photo quality.  The lens is sharp, and even wide open at wide angle the corners are only a little soft.  Another nice thing about the lens is that is starts at f/3.0 on the wide end.  That number represents the lens' aperture.  The lower than number the more light the lens can collect.  Most cameras in this class start at f/3.3 or more, so at wide angle the Olympus will be a better camera in low light.  At telephoto the lens is a not so great f/6.9, so you won't want to zoom with the Olympus in low light unless you have a tripod or are willing to live with the detail loss the required high ISO speeds will entail.<br /><br />Battery life is great and I was able to take 386 photos with lots of zooming, reviewing, and menu navigating before the battery died.<br /><br />All in all... a terrific mega-zoom compact camera.<br /><br />Feel free to leave a comment with any questions you may have and I'll answer them as soon as I can."
Olympus,Olympus Stylus SH-50 iHS Digital Camera with 24x Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Silver) (Old Model),20130823,B00DHEP8J4,5,43,49,"on August 23, 2013",ANONYMOUS,Great camera. Hits its niche.,"I have had probably a dozen or so digital cameras in the last 10 plus years ranging from what was at one time top of the line compacts in the 1-2 megapixel range with at most a 3x zoom, to DSLR's, and superzooms in between. At one point I needed them for work purposes and was always looking for good photos and video shot at long range in different lighting conditions.<br /><br />DSLR's are the best in the consumer class. I have an Olympus (E-510) with the 4/3rds sensor and a Canon (T1i) with APS-C. Both took outstanding pictures and despite now being several years old, are two that I have no plans to upgrade as for pics around the house and on trips, they really capture all the detail I need and most photos come out looking almost professional. Drawback however is the large size, especially with a decent zoom attached. I use them for important events but they sit more often or not as they are not fun to lug around for a long time or when I have no plans to shoot anything but want to be spontaneous and bring a camera along.<br /><br />Enter the compact cameras. I have not tried any of the mirrorless offering as they still seemed to big and lack zoom but I do have a Panasonic zs20 and Olympus XZ-1 as my most recent upgrades. Those I got a year ago and are the best comparisons for the SH-50, especially the ZS20 which I got for exactly the niche that the SH-50 is designed for.<br /><br />The SH-50 is built with typical Olympus heft. My E-510 and XZ-1 have great build quality. I love the E-510 despite it being 6 years old now. It was cheap when I got it but in the hand feels far better than a lot of the entry level Canon's and Nikons it was competing against (ditto for the lenses). So despite the fact I have Panasonics, Canon's and other 'bigger' brands I think highly of the Olympus stuff which seems to be better build wise than comparable offerings in the same price range. The SH-50 has good heft to, parts that fit together well, and no visible manufacturing flaws. It comes with a battery, wrist cord, stylus pen, charger, and manual/viewer on CD. It also has a quick guide that basically just shows you how to put the battery in and turn it on. (CD has a manual on it. If you don't want to install the viewer and other stuff the CD will try and make you do, just open the files on the CD, go to manuals, and for English open the ENU pdf.)<br /><br />Camera itself is a bit on the 'large for a compact' size. This is bigger than my ZS20 and almost the size of the XZ-1. The small camera case I use for the ZS20 won't fit the SH-50. Still a lot in a smaller package with the 24x zoom and various stabilizing systems. It is a pocketable camera. No GPS but I don't use mine on the ZS20 so no loss.<br /><br />Battery took a bit to charge. Looked to be at less than a 1/3 charged out of the box and took about two hours to hit full. It is a USB type charger with included wall plug in. Most of he USB charged cameras I have take a long time to charge up. Battery is a bit bigger and heavier than what I have in the ZS20 so it will hopefully last longer in the field (and probably why it took so long to charge up). No SD card is included but I had a 16gb Sony class 10 on hand that I put in. It powered up fine and I took it out for a test spin.<br /><br />I have a few tests I run with any new camera I get and I ran it through the same telephoto, moving subject, and movie tests.<br /><br />I will start with just normal photos. They are fine. Far less noise then the ZS20, despite both cameras having 1/2.3 sensors at about the same megapixel count. The XZ-1 takes better normal pictures but like a DSLR it has a bigger sensor. Cost of that on the XZ-1 is bigger sensor in a small camera, but with a significant loss of zoom capabilities. The SH-50 is a backlit CMOS so maybe this helps vs. the ZS20. The SH-50 has a pop-up flash that is hidden if you don't want to use it.<br /><br />Telephoto was excellent in good outdoor light. I was surprised by the lack of noise (in all shots) and the telephoto was very clear at 24x and even a click or two when zooming later on the computer. Auto focus was decent and if it focused on something I didn't want initially it would choose a second or third focus point when I re-half pressed the button to focus. Very nice when shooting through something like trees. 24x zoom in something this size is outstanding. The IS system works very well. At 24x you still need to hold very steady as you are asking a lot of the IS, but if you can do it the pics turn out good.<br /><br />Moving subjects in good light come out well in even the auto mode. I got some of the kids swinging and running around the backyard at about 630pm and some clouds so light was good but not great and there was no blurring. Definitely something I would feel comfortable with taking out to a ballgame or trip and getting good shots in a variety of conditions and while using some telephoto.<br /><br />Movie mode is where this camera shines vs. the other compacts I have. XZ-1 tops out at 720p. ZS20 will do 1080 at 60fps but the IS not as good (and I like Panny's IS). The IS on the SH-50 for video though really does work great. Best movies I have shot with a consumer class camera. Again good light is a big part of that with such a small sensor, but assuming your lighting is good the IS on the SH-50 gives you buttery smooth video. Audio is good and you can zoom with out motor noise. Some focus issues if you zoom in or out to fast but overall very good and great detail preserved at max zoom. IS at max zoom is stressed and looks to float, but again at 24x that is to be expected. Working with it at near zoom ranges it holds steady quite nicely.<br /><br />The only tip I will give is that you need to go into the 'on screen' menu to change the modes as far as frames per second goes. The SH-50 is set up to shoot 30fps out of the box in 1080 mode. This is great for slow moving events, but I took a test of the kids swinging and then jumping off and got a lot of motion artifacts with the quick movements. I saw that my pics were 30fps. Went into the 'menu' accessed by the menu button and found I could change 1080-720-VGA but nothing to adjust it off the 30fps. Even the 120fps mode isn't there. You need to look at the screen. Along the right are a series of icons. The one on top is a movie camera icon. You use the silver select dial to work with these. (Hello manual on the CD). This movie camera icon allows you to select the 1080i 60fps mode (Kids swinging and jumping of came out perfect) and the 720p 120fps mode. The 120fps mode is the best slo-mo I have used (The ZS20 has a similar mode as do a few others I have). The SH-50 though is 720p and captures by far the most detail. It isn't breaking glass or a drop of water exploding cool but for a bonus mode it is actually useable and fun. Good light though is a must in this mode or you will get detail loss and noise. For fun though it is neat and kids will love it.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with this camera. It is actually cheaper then, the now over a year old, ZS20 and takes better pictures (less noise, has more zoom, as good build quality, and takes better video). I like the ZS20 and in fact just used it last weekend at a 5K my wife was in and was pleased with the pics and video but the SH-50 is nicer especially with the better price point. I lose GPS but didn't use it anyways. The XZ-1 with its larger sensor takes better portraits, low light photos, and less then 4x zoom photos. It should though with its larger sensor, just like my DSLR's take much better pics then the XZ-1. But the XZ-1 has lesser video and no where near the zoom range. That is the trade off if you want to carry 24x zoom in your pocket, you need the smaller sensor to pull it off.<br /><br />The SH-50 gives you the flexibility to take near and extreme far pics as well as video. If you are like me on trips or kids events, you want that flexibility of choice and are willing to give up that larger sensor to get some of those other benefits in a small package. If you are going to be shooting indoors and at close range and want small size look at something like the XZ-1 or similar bigger sensor  compacts. With the SH-50 it will do decent photos inside and close but its niche is 'small with massive stabilized zoom'. It nails that and adds top notch video.  For the price this is a great travel zoom camera. I would recommend it."

I've had it for a few months and am still discovering wonderful new things that it can do. A camera like this would have cost well over $1000 a couple years ago and it would have been bigger and bulkier. As some of the reviews point out, about the only things this does not have are WiFi and GPS, but I could care less. What''s the point of WiFi in a camera. I like to have control of downloading the photos and videos, especially when I don't want them all. And I've never been a fan of GPS on a camera. Sure it's kind cool, but not worth the tradeoff of many of the other features on this awesome camera."

First the camera started to reboot every time I turned the flash on.  Then the camera would reboot at random intervals.  I did some research and other people were complaining about the same problem.

Olympus,Olympus C-750 4MP Digital Camera w/ 10x Optical Zoom,20030929,B00008IHU2,5,49,50,"on September 29, 2003",ANONYMOUS,The Best 700 Series Yet!,"The long awaited Olympus 750 is the latest in a line of excellent relatively compact, long lens models. The last model, the 740, was a stop-gap measure that allowed the company to position a new model in the line while they worked out the kinks in the 750's updated autofocus system. The result was worth waiting for, as a much faster system now exists that allows the camera to take better advantage of low light and fast action scenes.<br />In addition, the 750 addresses another of the 740's drawbacks, the lack of sound on the occasionally very useful movie feature has been fixed. Many users will also be pleased to note that finally they have upped the maximum resolution from 3 to 4 megs.<br />Still troublesome however is the lack of stabilization, making long range zoom shots very tricky. In point of fact, zooming on any camera at 10X without a tripod or image stabilization is extremely challenging.<br />Anyway, this camera is beautifully made and ergonomically engineered. The aspherical all glass lens system is excellent and the resulting 4 megapixel images are crystal clear at 11&quot; x 14&quot; and beyond. The zoom of course remains the trump card on the 750, and the smoothness (just the right damping) with which it reaches its 10x limit is awesome.<br />The 750 (a feature that began with the 730) is the third Olympus to utilize the new xD memory card format, the &quot;xD-Picture Card&quot;. This is a new type of ultra-compact memory media developed jointly by Fuji and Olympus. The main features of the xD-Picture Card are its ultra-compact size (20.0 x 25.0 x 1.7mm), its lower power consumption (the xD Picture-Card users will benefit from the convenience and savings of longer battery life on a single charge) and its faster read/write speeds. Of course, a new card means a new card-reader will be needed, but these are inexpensive and aren't immediately needed, as the camera can be linked by the included USB cable to your PC without too much fuss.<br />Overall, I think the 750 is the Olympus most users have been waiting for, sans stabilization. Whether that system (present on my Olympus 2100 &amp; far from perfect) is in the works on a 760 model I cannot say, but if you're in the market for a relatively compact digicam with a very long zoom, you can hardly go wrong with any of the 700 series by Olympus."

The biggest bonus is that I can play with different settings without having to pay to see the results.<br />This camera is crammed with features.

Gotta take your time and keep the camera really still.<br />I would advise investing in 128MB extra memory - it allows about 30 pics at full resolution and about 400 at 1024 x 768."

I am kind of annoyed that there isn't more warning of low batteries. Twice I have had it die right in the middle of a photo (one of the photos can't be replaced) and good luck getting the lens to retract when the batteries die. Another problem is the purpling effect in some photos. One example is a shot taken up the trunk of a tree through a canopy of leaves, the purple effect was very apparent. This was done at F3.2. I tried again at F4.5 and it was better but probably would have still been obvious on a print. I also have a Canon G2 and tried the same shot and it did fine. I have even noticed purple on well exposed photos in sunny day scenes. The camera also just shut off once for no apparent reason.<br /> On the upside the pictures are good overall. The 10x zoom lens makes clear pictures. The camera seems to be built well and seems like one that would last. You also have the option of TIFF format, although this is kind of a laugh with a 16MB memory card.<br />  The software with the camera is not bad. I do remember my computer locking up a few times in the &quot;Browse Images&quot; selection.<br /> I would probably give this camera 3 1/2 stars overall. If you really want that 10x zoom you might be able to live with some of the problems mentioned above. If you're really nitpicky about things like the purple effect then you might want to keep shopping."
