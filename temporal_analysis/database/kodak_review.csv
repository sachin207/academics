It would consistently focus behind the subject unless the subject was large enough to mostly fill the screen. Granted, I don't expect perfection from auto focus cameras so I poked around for a way to pre-set the focus which I thought might work in the CS, Custom Settings, screen. When I would rotate the dial to CS it would go into panorama mode and no menu items pertaining to CS were available. The top rotary dial sometimes seems a little uncertain but works ok most of the time. Overall it just feels delicate. Picture quality is pretty good but once again it's a cheap auto camera so my bad.  Bottom line is that I can't recommend this camera, for a point and shoot camera my 10 year old 7mp pocket Sony works better."

I have not taken many long range shots but I have a new tripod coming to help with that. I have taken lots of movies and they are very good using my old tripod. I take movies of the grand kids while they are in sports and they come out fine, whereas my old camera got kind of fuzzy if you moved it too quick. The controls are easy to use although I use the automatic setting most of the time. The Zoom feature can be a little tricky until you get used to it but the lever is in a good spot.<br />A couple of things I don't like. First, I take lots of closeup pictures and the strap and lens covers is always in the way. I can get used to that. Second, some pictures turn out very white. Other times when taking people pictures or movies in uneven lighting, like a gym, some of the people will look good and some will be white in the same picture.

At this point, I am the one holding the AZ651 back.Even without a monopod or tripod I'm getting excellent results in both fine and best JPEG settings and I'm shooting RAW as well, which I can circle back around to and edit with the software Kodak includes on the disc in the box.The function ring around the barrel of the camera can be set to control different functions such as f-stops, shutter speed, ISO and more. And you can operate the zoom lens that way too. It accepts filters on that wonderfully powerful zoom lens, I put a 52mm ND2 on there, but you can use anything you like or don't because the camera will compensate and includes various built-in filter effects.What I'm really enjoying is that it is both a serious camera off auto, you get a decent amount of f-stops to play with and enough ISO and shutter speed selections to make most folks happy, and I haven't seen any noticeable grain to speak of unless I zoom in a ridiculous amount in on finished photos. I've even shot in terrible lighting conditions on purpose after shutting the flash off and I'm still getting great results with the expected very fine grain for very low light situations.This camera also knows how to have fun. There's a series of effects you can use that while they do slow down the time between shots since the camera is processing them are clearly meant for family fun. Effects like negative, mirror, punk, and a ton more including kodachrome. I've only been shooting for five days now, so a bit early for a review, but this camera deserves kudos for carrying on the Kodak tradition of an easy to use camera that can also wait patiently for the photographer to grow into the more advanced modes off auto.Oh, before I forget, the AZ651 shoots video like a dream, does excellent macro as well as telephoto, and just make your colors pop even in a normal color setting. I haven't even tried everything this camera can do such as a digital addition to that powerful zoom or a completely RAW shoot since I've been under the weather, but I'd say check out the manual on the web site which goes into a lot better detail that I can to check out all the bells and whistles. I'm very happy I went with a Kodak and thrilled to see these wonderful cameras back out there no matter who is making them.Oh, there is one thing you should know about. This camera will get lots of second looks and even thirds. Do expect it to be bigger than your EasyShare if you have the same model I did with a generous LCD you can flip out and around and do all sorts of neat things with, including tucking it back into the body so it doesn't get knocked around or scratched up.UPDATE: I've had the camera about a month now and its capabilities are amazing. I even wrote a review on HubPages with both JPEG and RAW photo samples if you'd like to see photos and a more detailed review. http://nightcat.hubpages.com/hub/kodakpixproaz651review"

The disposable cameras were real fun for our guests during the reception however I would say this is true for any disposable camera.What was most disappointing was the results after developing the photos. Of the 15 cameras I purchases, none of the cameras developed the full 27 photos. At most 5 of the cameras had approximately 10-15 clear photos (out of a possible of 27). The remaining 10 cameras had even less developed photos.In addition, of the photos that were developed, not very many were of good quality. Many of the photos were grainy and had a 70s feel. I felt they were worse quality than the disposable cameras I used as a kid. Since the event was indoors, we told our guests that using flash was best. Even then, many of our guests looked like ghosts in the photos.If you are using the disposable cameras for the purpose of novelty, then this may be the thing for you. However, if you were hoping to keep any photos afterward, then perhaps it'd be best to stick with other alternatives."

I kept working at it for days, even notified the company I bought it from that it was not working and I wanted to return it. Forget online help page, I registered with them 3 times and 3 times they said they sent me a notice to my email which they did not, it kept telling me the camera had not had the USA picked for it's destination and would go no further, which it did have it. I tried typing in choosing digital cameras from their help page and it shout the page down right away every time! I never could get live chat......I finally got a number to call by going to their page on facebook. After all that I come to find out they NO LONGER SHARE ONE TOUCH WITH ANYTHING BUT EMAIL AND YOUR COMPUTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also you better buy a memory card with it if you do buy it, because the internal one holds very few pictures. The pictures come out fine and I like them, even from far away when I zoom and they look like they are going to be all grainy, when you see the picture after it is taken it is not grainy at all, actually very clear...........<br />I gave it a 3 due to the fact that there is still not disclaimer on it anywhere you search for this camera that tells you it no longer shares with the above places........so if you just want a nice bulky camera with 21 power zoom at a decent price go for it.....if you want it for those features I mentioned, forget it.<br />Thanks<br />P.S SENT BACK THE REFURBISHED CAMERA AND BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW....I HAVE TO SAY I AM NOT HAPPY WITH KODAK TECH SUPPORT AT ALL!!!!!!! TRIED CALLING AND GET THE MESSAGE THAT THEY NO LONGER SUPPORT THE ONLINE SOFTWARE....ALL I WANT IS TO KNOW WHY IT IS NOT DOING WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO? CAN'T EMAIL PICS, CAN'T NAME THEM, VERY FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW.

It's for people who just want to point a camera at things, press a button, and get sharp, accurately exposed photographs in return. The Kodak EasyShare Z5010 does those things with relative ease. There are a few hiccups along the way, but considering this camera's price-point, noone should be expecting a high end DLSR packed into a point & shoot body; you simply aren't going to find that in any entry level consumer P&S camera, plain and simple.This camera does take sharp photographs, with accurate exposure in fair to excellent lighting conditions. The pictures start to get a little too noisy for my taste over ISO 400 however, so it wouldn't be my first choice for low light or night photography. The automatic flash exposure is set a bit strong by default and washes things out in most instances. With this camera, I found it's better to try to compesate the flash exposure by -2/3 stop, which allows the flash to act more as subtle fill flash. Another option is to put a piece of clear cellophane tape over the flash, which is a cheap and non-destructive way of diffusing the light in a more pleasant manner.The automatic focus point is a bit fidgity, it likes to wander all over the place searching for things to focus on, but since most of the modes used have tend to take pictures with a large depth of field, its mostly a non-issue for average snapshots.What this camera does well:* Takes sharp, crisp photos. Only at the very extreme focal lengths do the images start getting soft on the corners. Pincushion and barrel distortion are minimal, which is is a very pleasant surprise!* No purple fringing issues noticeable in high contrast situations. This is exceptional for a camera of this price point.* Share button app is simple, fun, and easy to use. If ever there were a social networking point & shoot camera, this is the one to have.* Well balanced, easy to grip, buttons and control are convenient. Not too big, not too small. Juuuuuuust right.*Menu system is easy to navigate and understand. Nothing archaic here, and no submenus of submenus to get lost in. Kodak deserves a huge pat on the back for this one.The camera lacks several things that I find noteworthy:* There is no optical viewfinder. I find the lack of an optical viewfinder disconcerting. While the LCD display is mostly useable, it's not nearly as nice when tracking moving objects as would be when using a viewfinder. This is especially true when trying to take videos.* There are no Aperature Priority and Shutter Priority modes. You either get full auto, a manual mode, and lots of scene modes that usually offer less creative control than the two noteably missing modes mentioned.* There is no hot-shoe for adding an optional hot-shoe flash. While that is rarely found on compact point & shoot cameras, nearly every camera could benefit from this simple addition.* Battery life is mediocre at best with the supplied rechargeable batteries. I highly recommend getting a few sets of Sanyo Eneloop batteries to power this. Not only will you get more exposures per charge, but you'll also have the benefit of the batteries holding their charge in storage for a much longer period of time. Chuck the charger they send with it in the junk drawer and get a smart charger with automatic refresh and bad battery detection; your rechargeable batteries will live a much longer life if you do this simple thing.So is it good enough to rate the four stars I gave it? Yes, I think it's very good for the general market it was aimed for. While some of the features feel too dumbed down as far as allowing users more control over their pictures, the final outcome is still that of photographs with exceptional picture quality."

We send them to the customer, or our website or facebook. This camera really means 'EasyShare' we have no problems sending images quickly! The quality of the camera, lens, focus lines zoom are very good!<br />The size is a nice size also, it is not compact like other digital cameras, however it is not as big as our Canon Rebel.The zoom - which I thought would be its downfall if VERY nice, the color rendering is VERY nice as well as it's picture taking speed, and battery life.Being used as a 'shop camera' this has taken its share of abuse - I have dropped it twice, it has been out in the rain (and snow) been taken from the warm shop into the field, and so far no problems AT ALL no fogging, no glitches - nothing! it does what is supposed to and advertised to do.. it take great pictures that are EASY to share on facebook , emails, websites etc..!Definitely worth the money and a step above compact digital cameras/phones.Jim"

The zoom control on this camera is on the back of the camera, and there is no view finder. Other than those, this is a very similar camera to the Z990.Pros:<br />Great low-light camera for still objects<br />Vivid colors on scenery shots- captures the colors of the mountains and other scenery in the Anchorage area very well<br />Good image stabilization<br />21x optical zoom<br />Detailed close up shots or macro shots are very crisp, as long as you don't try to zoom in on it and the camera is about 6 inches away from what you're photographing.Cons:<br />Has the same issue as the Z990 about trying to zoom in close on something 5 feet away. I like to take photos of flowers and other things that way sometimes if I can't get close to it. This doesn't focus well in that range when you zoom in on something<br />Colors can be a little too saturated- some people like that, but it can look garish<br />Auto-focus can be a little iffy- you might have to try a couple times to get the focus on what you want to stand outSince what I need is a camera that does well on my macro shots, I'm giving my husband my Z990, keeping my Fujifilm HS10 and this camera for my photographing needs. The HS10 doesn't take the same quality photos for my crafts and is considerably bulkier than this camera. The HS10 also has lower megapixels, but does a lot better than either Kodak camera for birds and zooming in on something that's in that zone that the Kodaks don't work. It doesn't take low light shots as well or take photos of food or crafts as well. This camera fills that spot well enough that I'm happy to give my husband the better Kodak for his photos."
Kodak,Kodak EasyShare Z5010 Digital Camera,20111030,B005KG3NSK,3,44,48,"on October 30, 2011",ANONYMOUS,Ultrazoom for Picture Takers,"A friend of mine asked the other day why anyone would buy a camera when their iphone took such quality pictures.  Now this guy isn't a rube who thinks an iphone is the best quality out there, he knows that there are expensive cameras that take professional quality pictures are out there, DSLRs they are called.  He wasn't dismissing those as much as he was questioning the need for the point and shoot models. Those are the cameras for people who don't fancy themselves photographers, they just want to take pictures.That's the group I'm in.  I like taking pictures, good pictures even, and often lots of them.  But I don't want to spend  a lot of time thinking about the camera or the lighting or the shot quality.  I see something I like, I want to take a picture of it.I have professional photographers for friends and while I envy their fancy cameras, and the pictures they take, I know I don't have the interest to put in the time to learn the details about all the specific settings, and the lingo that goes with it. I know a little, enough to get by, but like I said I just want to take pictures.And because I often want to take pictures of things that are far away, like birds or scenery or other distant objects, I love the ultrazoom category of cameras that have arisen in the last decade.  They provide a great ability to zoom in, without having to pay thousands of dollars for a fancy lens.My first ultrazoom was the Canon S2IS, which I loved.  When it finally broke, I got a SX20IS.  I like it, though honestly I think the S2IS took better pictures.  While the larger megapixel size (14MP!) sounds more impressive, the trouble is that the sensor in the camera doesn't really translate higher quality, just bigger picture size.  Pictures come out softer, with fuzzier details, and need more digital post-processing (Photoshop!).Those cameras cost about $400 new.  Which made me very interested in this Kodak z5010.  Having a fair amount of experience with point and shoot ultrazooms, I have a pretty mixed opinion of this camera now that I've played around with it a while.First off, the feel of it is noticeably cheaper.  It has the plastic feel of a cheap camera, with a very simple layout.  The LCD screen is large but of a low quality, and there's no viewfinder to look through, so the LCD is all you have, making it a little tricky to see the quality of the picture taken.  But with cheap comes easy, and so it this camera is quite user friendly. You can pick it up and play with it right off the bat.  Everything is clearly labeled and each setting provides a little instruction on the screen when chosen.So, a minus for how it feels, but a plus for how easy it is to use.As far as picture quality, well, it's not nearly as good as my canon cameras.  The image quality is decent at close up, but at the far reaches of the zoom, everything becomes grainy and distorted, feeling more like a digital zoom (which uses the software to mimic zoom).  The edges were extremely soft, and the same scene taken with both this kodak and my canon shows significantly more blur with the Kodak, especially as the picture is examined at full size.However, there's that price difference.  This camera costs about half as much as my canon.  This is an important point, as so often cameras are divided into only two categories: the DSLRs and the Point and Shoots.  However, within each category there are significant differences among needs and cameras kinds.  There are point and shoot cameras which try to provide a near DSLR experience.  And there are point and shoots which are good for holiday pictures and family shots.  The latter are a lot less expensive, are more user friendly, and offer a lot less options.And that's precisely where this Kodak fits in, an ultrazoom for those who are more concerned with ease of use than options.  It's a camera for someone who likes the quality of their smartphone pictures, but wants to be able to zoom in more and take a wider variety of shots.  What kind of wider variety?  Well, it has a very easy panoramic mode, much better than my canon, that shows the previous picture taken so you can line up the next ones (thus negating the need for more steps afterwards in software).  It provides the ability to change focus and shutter speed and other options, while also giving a lot of presets for different settings and needs.So, this camera definitely fills a niche.  It's a great camera for those who just want to enjoy taking and sharing pictures.  And sharing is probably its stand out feature.  You can set it up to tag specific people automatically, then upload the tagged photos to facebook or email or flickr or a bunch of other sites.  In effect, the camera in general is made to avoid the need for any software adjustments or middle steps.It's a camera that provides a decent picture and great sharing options, made for the niche of folks who just are documenting their fun, not making the photography the goal.  It's about half the cost of other higher end point and shoot ultra zooms, making it more accessible to a wider audience, but the trouble is that for only a little more you can get it's reputably higher quality brother ultrazoom, the Z990.  So, for this present model to be worth it, I'd say it would have to come down in price another 30% or more, as it is much more suitable for the under 150 dollar market in terms of quality.Would I recommend it?  Yes, to specific people who want an easy to use camera with a fair amount of features and aren't particular about overall quality and who don't want to mess around with software. But, again, I'd suggest checking out the Z990 model instead. If the price is anywhere near each other, that is the much better choice ."
Kodak,Kodak EasyShare Z5010 Digital Camera,20111026,B005KG3NSK,3,162,170,"on October 26, 2011",ANONYMOUS,14MP does not make up for its shortcomings...,"Three stars stands for 'It's Okay' in the Amazon review system.... Just 'okay'<br />I must say, I'd love to see Kodak be the number one USA digital camera maker, they have been in the photo industry so very long and have been a respected camera company for decades.<br />Sticker on the bottom says this one is made in Indonesia.I'll have to judge photo quality against our Canon Powershot A630 & A640 in the same price range, I use more expensive Canon cameras but unfair to compare to this price range.Kodak must have designed the Z5010 to hit a price point I guess, since it's the latest 2011 release but is far less in the specifictions and features than their slightly more expensive (MSRP) Z990 MAX that came out earlier this year.After a hundred test shots in various situations and lighting I find it will take decent photos when there is lots of nice bright sun, and will take some okay photos with the built in flash, but makes way too much noise if you use it for low light photography.Most all the shots I've taken are pretty soft at all settings...  All cameras have a 'sweet' spot but so far I've not been able to find one with this camera.  14 whopping MP and you can't crop in more than a couple of steps before the shot turns to a mess.  I don't want to post photos here since most any will look good at the greatly reduced display size showing on Amazon.The Z5010 lists 'IS' Image stabilization but I can't see that it works much or at all, so many motion blur shots without that much hand shake on my part.  Same with the video ISStart up times from off are pretty good at around 4 secondsControls are fast and easy to useFast one button press to go from camera to photo review and back again... very niceUsing AA batteries can be both good and bad depending on how you look at them.  Lithium packs charge quicker, hold their charge longer when not in use and take more photos per charge, but AA cells are cheaper and can be upgraded as others come out with more capacity etc.<br />Once you are used to using a single Lithium pack it's hard to go back to messing with multiple cells, but otherwise they are no real problem.  Max on the market as of this date is 2700mah but brands DO vary in quality and length of useful life.A faster 'smart' charger is needed along with a second set of cells to have with you if you plan to take lots of photos.  Not a brand recommendation but as sample;&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Combo-Tenergy-T-3150-Smart-AA-AAA-NiMH-NiCd-Battery-Charger-4-Premium-AA-2500mAh-NiMH-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B004ZH838U/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Combo: Tenergy T-3150 Smart AA/AAA NiMH/NiCd Battery Charger + 4 Premium AA 2500mAh NiMH Rechargeable Batteries</a>&nbsp;there are many brands and kits out there, just make sure it's 'Smart' so it reads the cells and adjusts itself for best charge.Internal memory is only 90mb so you don't get to save much without a SDHC card inserted.No memory card supplied so be sure to purchase a good high speed card with lots of room if you plan to record HD video, for example;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/PNY-Professional-16-GB-Class-10-Hi-Speed-SDHC-20MB-s-133x-Flash-Memory-Card-P-SDHC16G10-EF-Black/dp/B003ZHTNNU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>PNY Professional 16 GB Class 10 Hi-Speed SDHC 20MB/s 133x Flash Memory Card P-SDHC16G10-EF (Black)</a><a class='a-link-normal' href='/PNY-Professional-8-GB-Class-10-Hi-Speed-SDHC-20MB-s-133x-Flash-Memory-Card-P-SDHC8G10-EF-Black/dp/B003ZHTNNK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>PNY Professional 8 GB Class 10 Hi-Speed SDHC 20MB/s 133x Flash Memory Card P-SDHC8G10-EF (Black)</a>&nbsp;Internal memory is only 90mb so you don't get to save much without a card inserted.

Even a regular CMOS would be improvement.Highest ISO is 1600 down from their best 3200 & 6400 on other model....although, the Z5010 does not do well with low light high ISO noise even at 1600 with this CCDHD video is better quality for me than stills so far, except for the fact that it does not have optical zoom feature while you are taking videos...  a pretty common desire for most people.<br />You still have 5X digital zoom to use, but quality drops the more you zoom out with digital rather than optical.  Please note that I confirmed this lack of 'optical' zoom in video mode with Kodak customer service directly and is not an opinion or mistake on my part.Resolution is also down from full 1080 to 720 from the MAX z990Video records fast and smooth at 720 HD when used with a good class 10 high speed card.<br />Even for rapid succession 'burst' still shots, the link between memory card and camera has to be as fast as it can be in order to not get backed up and slowed down causing problems.Please do yourself a favor if you are considering this Kodak camera and have a look at the full specs and features of their other new (Jan 2011) camera.&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Kodak-EasyShare-Max-Z990-New-Model/dp/B004FLL53Q/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Kodak EasyShare Max Z990 (New Model)</a>&nbsp;I can't say it would please me for picture quality any more than the Z5010 but you will sure get more camera for the small price difference, and at times even less money than the Z5010.UPDATE 11/2011;  I found when taking videos with the Z5010... no matter what size memory card you use in it, in any one video you can only record 2 GB (about 10 minutes) of HD720p and only 2 GB (about 25 minutes) at lowest res VGA setting!  Thought it was malfunction but found it listed in the manual.Now at the 600 shot mark with this camera. The camera, even with a high speed memory card ,is pretty slow 'processing' the more you use it in an outing and you can miss many shots waiting for the last photo to finish writing to memory card."
Kodak,Kodak EasyShare Z5010 Digital Camera,20111025,B005KG3NSK,4,88,94,"on October 25, 2011",ANONYMOUS,"Nice 21X Optical Zoom, OK Picture Quality, Bulky","First I'd like to say that if you already own or prefer Kodak cameras, you will probably like this one.  I think Kodak has a large following of brand-loyal users who have stuck with Kodak since film camera days. Kodak isn't my first choice for digital cameras; my opinion is the Fuji line has better picture quality. The pictures I've taken with this camera are too soft for my own personal preference.  Maybe you like softer photos though. I also found it odd that outdoors on an overcast day at 4 PM that the flash would pop up and fire when on other cameras it would not under the same circumstances. I couldn't decide whether to give this camera 3 or 4 stars, it's OK and I like it, but there are other better cameras I love.PROS:<br />>  The Mode Dial seems substantial and I like the clicking sound it makes when dialing it.<br />>  Burst Mode (easy access on top of camera shared with self-timer button):  You can hold the shutter down and take up to 31 pictures at once, depending on the picture size you have chosen - this ranges from 8 to 31 shots, one after another (but you cannot use the flash with burst).<br />>  HD videos - 720p and they seem fairly decent quality so far - I uploaded a short video on YouTube under the user name Yarii41.<br />>  You can choose to put the date on the picture (or not) in the set-up menu.CONS:<br />>  Battery compartment door is flimsy. A little hard to close and latch down with the batteries inside.<br />>  Zooming out to 21X can be somewhat blurry - a tripod is ESSENTIAL if you can't keep the camera steady.<br />>  Lens cap - I prefer the other style that opens/retracts when the camera is turned on/off.  This lens cap is designed like those found on DSLR cameras, but it will go flying off if you don't have it tethered to the neck strap and forget to remove it before powering the camera on. I forget to remove it and get a 'lens obstructed' error message.ZOOMING DURING VIDEO:  You can't use the OPTICAL zoom DURING the video.  You have to zoom out before pressing the shutter button. You CAN zoom with this Kodak DURING the video, but it's strictly digital zoom, so it will be somewhat grainy and not as good quality.This is a hefty camera; it's plastic, but not cheap, thin plastic. It comes with 4 rechargeable AA batteries and a very slow charger.  Painfully slow, so I recommend getting some Sanyo Eneloops (see link below) along with a faster charger.The shutter lag time is fast. I rarely miss the shot while waiting on the shutter to respond. It's fast when using no flash, and seems maybe a second or 2 slower when using the flash, because the flash has to pop up/open. BUT -- recycling time (when it's ready to take the next picture) takes 2 to 3 seconds using the flash, probably due to the camera using AA batteries; my cameras that use lithium batteries are much faster. So if you have a baby, or young grand-kids, or even pets, you may miss a shot waiting for the camera to be ready for the next shot.NOTE: The manual says to use an SDHC Card with a MINIMUM Class 4 rating;  however, in my opinion, Class 4 is not good enough.  I think at least a Class 6 but preferably a Class 10 rating - they don't cost that much more and you will be happier when shooting videos with a Class 10 SDHC card.  Camera does not come with an SD card, you need to purchase one separately, there is some internal memory, but not enough to take any more than a couple pictures.On the Mode Dial you can choose 'M' for manual control should you desire - you can set your own aperture, shutter speed, flash compensation and ISO. Likewise, if you are completely camera-challenged, just leave the Mode Dial turned to Smart Capture and let the camera do everything for you.  There's also a P setting (Program Mode) and several scene modes, but normally I leave it on the Smart Capture setting so I don't have to fiddle around with settings.SOFTWARE:  There is no Kodak software CD in the box.  The software is stored on the camera and you go through a set-up the first time the camera is connected to your computer.  For some reason it didn't work right (using Vista) so I had to download the 'Share Button App' from Kodak's web site. I wasn't impressed by it.BOTTOM LINE:  This isn't a small camera.  You'll be happy with this camera if you already know you like Kodak and don't mind it being large, bulky and heavy, it weighs over 16 ounces.  It takes decent pictures and the zoom is excellent.  This SLR-style camera demands its own bag, it won't fit in your pants pocket unless you are wearing MC Hammer's parachute pants.Sanyo Eneloop Batteries:&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Sanyo-XX-Battery-Powered-by-eneloop-2500mAh-High-Capacity-4-Pack-AA-Ni-MH-Pre-Charged-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B0058GZWXQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Sanyo XX Battery Powered by eneloop, 2500mAh High Capacity, 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries</a>"

Kodak,Kodak EasyShare Z5010 Digital Camera,20120121,B005KG3NSK,4,8,8,"on January 21, 2012",ANONYMOUS,"A very simple to use introductory camera, for a decent price","I am reviewing this camera as someone who has a lot of experience with fully automatic cameras and video cameras, but little to no experience with manual settings.I think this camera would be a nice purchase for someone who doesn't have a lot of camera experience but not as good a choice for someone who is really into picture taking -I'd get a more advanced model instead.This camera IS really easy to use, a reputation that Kodak continues to live up to, and it does basic functions very well.A note about the SHARE feature.  I had high hopes for it, and though it worked, it wasn't nearly as impressive as I hoped.  It takes a little bit of customization, is NOT WIFI capable (which would have been better) and I don't think it would be very useful for most users.  HOWEVER, I think this would be great for a teenager -someone who's really interesting in sending lots of pictures to various friends.  (You have to preprogram people's email addresses in the camera, and then you have to hook a cable up to your computer, and then you have to select which users you want to send pictures to, and then they are sent.  I, personally, would rather just drag and drop the pictures and email them on my own separately.)  I didn't add any stars or deduct any stars for this feature, but I wanted to point it out...Another note.  There is a cap (to protect the lens) and a string you can use to attach the cap to the camera (so that you don't lose it).  This is great, except for one problem.  The cap then can hang in front of the camera and block your picture.  You have to be careful to avoid the cap (or hold it) while taking a picture.  Of course, you also have the option to not attach the string to the cap and camera and then just remove the cap manually when taking pictures...PROS:+++ SIMPLE TO USE.  If you are giving this to someone who is camera shy (but secretly wishes they could take pictures) then this is a great camera to give.  It is relatively intuitive, and you don't have to read an instruction manual if you've used other smaller cameras by either Canon, Sony, or Kodak.+++ GREAT ZOOM.  It has 21X Zoom.  This is probably the biggest, most impressive, function of this camera.  I would highly recommend it for someone who takes a lot of nature photography, as you can really get in close, with this pretty inexpensive camera.++ TAKES REGULAR BATTERIES.  This is a plus if you don't want to invest in purchasing additional proprietary batteries (for another brand and model of camera).  For people who want things very simple, there isn't much simpler than this: if your batteries run down, go to any store to buy normal AA replacements.++ HD VIDEO CAPABLE.  Though not 1080i (which I wouldn't expect at this price-point), this camera takes respectable 720 HD video.  This is a very nice feature.++ EDITING ON CAMERA.  This camera allows you to edit on the camera.  I thought that THAT was pretty neat.++ MULTIPLE PICTURE BURSTS.  This camera allows you to choose a setting which will take multiple bursts of pictures, allowing you to catch an action without having to wait for the typical slow recycle time before taking another picture.CON:-- NO OPTICAL ZOOM ON VIDEO.  You cannot zoom in or out when taking video.  This is a pain, but then again, for this price, because this is not a dedicated video camera, it is not a deal killer.  (But, buy something else if you really want to take a lot of videos.)-- SLOW RECYCLE SPEED.  Once you take a picture you have to wait several seconds before taking another and seeing how it turns out.  This can be moderately annoying when you are in a group setting and have to wait a bit before trying to take another picture.- BULKY.  This is not a real negative, because you are buying a camera with a huge zoom, and the camera, therefore, HAS to be bulky-ish.  Just realize that it is pretty big and has to be carried over your shoulder or in a bag (and not in a pocket).- NO MANUAL FOCUS.  If you are comfortable always using automatic features then this won't be a problem.

Kodak,Kodak EasyShare Z5010 Digital Camera,20111221,B005KG3NSK,4,6,7,"on December 21, 2011",ANONYMOUS,"Some minor drawbacks, but great overall.","When I first picked the Kodak EasyShare Z5010, I was a little disappointed. It feels fairly flimsy, especially without the batteries, and the functionality seems pretty basic. But as I took this camera around a bit more, it grew on me quite a bit. Take as an example the wide-angle lens. There's something about this lens that makes my pictures pop, in my opinion, whereas my other digital cameras often leave pictures with a flat quality. However, the biggest surprise was the ease with which this camera takes panoramic shots. Unlike my other cameras which require a smooth panning motion (fairly tricky to pull off sometimes), this camera allows you to take three easily aligned pictures which it then weaves into a panoramic image.There are, of course, some mediocre aspects of this camera. For example, I found the 'easy share' feature to be fairly useless. Yes, the camera and software do make it very easy to upload photos, but I feel it's already easy enough to do manually. Speaking of the software, it's nothing to write home about. Most people, including me, have their favorite editing programs, and there's nothing in this package that will draw anybody away.There are other aspects of the camera worth mentioning. The use of AA batteries seems to be something people either love or hate, but given the fact that this camera comes with a battery recharger (plus four rechargeable batteries), I can't complain. The 21x optical zoom is pretty nice, though I think not atypical of a camera like this. The quality of the LCD screen could also be a bit better, but is still more than adequate. Overall, I found these to be very minor drawbacks, and I'm still very happy with this camera."
Kodak,Kodak EasyShare Z5010 Digital Camera,20111217,B005KG3NSK,5,8,10,"on December 17, 2011",ANONYMOUS,Great Value for the money,"Some people think that all camera are the same. I know if I buy a $275.00 camera such as this, it will out shoot my $150 camera, but I cannot expect it to shoot as well as a $500 camera, and so on. Now, this camera has a lot of features and is a nice littl upgrade for someone going from a point and shoot (pocket, purse cam) to something with more options, wider angles and that can let more light into the lens. The zoom is wonderful at 21x, most pocket cams get you only 5x at the most. The SDHC cards are a lot less expensive than most, she paid $24.00 for her 4gb Sony ProDuo in the Summer, an 8gb SDHC card hits around $10.00 (I picked up 3 for her and got free shipping here at Amazon) This was a purchase for my wife to move up from her smaller camera. She did not want one that you had to change lenses and worry about a lot of settings, she loves it. I can out shoot her with my Canon T2i, but it was 3x the amount of $$$ and should be able to do as much. I know the limitations of my cameras, and I work to push them as far as they will go. When I want more, I upgrade. Great camera for the money, check it out or one of the others that are similar form Kodak or even the Fuji film line (very similar) that I was also considering when I made this purchase."
Kodak,Kodak EasyShare Z5010 Digital Camera,20111212,B005KG3NSK,4,3,3,"on December 12, 2011",ANONYMOUS,Good Starter Camera - Recommended w/Caveats,"This Kodak EasyShare Z5010 camera is a decent introductory entry for those wanting more than a 'point and shoot' and are not ready for a dSLR. I have used this for camera over a month now for everything from family pictures to business product pictures and have come away fairly satisfied with it's capabilities. Here are my observations:Includes:<br />* Camera<br />* Lens Cap<br />* Neck Strap<br />* Battery Charger with 4 AA BatteriesPros:<br />+ Body Size; larger body camera provides for decent grip<br />+ Presets; offers a wide range of preset shooting options including the 'Smart Capture' mode that features automatic scene selection and image optimization (which is pretty good and the setting I usually default to), manual Scene Selection mode (Fireworks, Portrait, Backlight, Stage, Children, Flower/Macro, etc), and other modes are easy to select directly on the dial including Sports, video (good, but not exceptional), Manual, Program, Portrait, Landscape, and Panorama (stitches pictures together in camera)<br />+ Lens; features a very good wide-angle 21X zoom lens that has limited distortion at either end of the range<br />+ Low Lag; good first shot and follow up speed<br />+ Battery Life; takes 4 AA batteries (included w/charger) and has reasonably good lifeCons:<br />- Software; somewhat lackluster, comes preloaded on camera and installs when connected to the PC (installed second time on my Win 7 laptop), but it is very limited compared to standard editing programs). The 'Share' button allows preselection of options, such as FaceBook, FlickR, Twitter, email, etc when the camera is connected to PCMisc:<br />* Image Quality; while generally color accurate and acceptable, it is a little 'softer' than expected for a 14MP cameraThose wanting more control might want consider a different camera but, overall, this is a decent everyday use camera that can be left in 'Smart Capture' mode for most of my picture taking needs and there is a preconfigured setting for just about everything else.Recommended, with the caveats above.CFH"
Kodak,Kodak EasyShare Z5010 Digital Camera,20111211,B005KG3NSK,4,5,9,"on December 11, 2011",ANONYMOUS,good digital camera for beginners,"12/12/11: Update<br />Just spent the weekend with this camera. Brought this out for our holiday family get-together (so lots of action shots of the kids running around, posed family portraits and a few quick videos.So my absolute favorite thing about the Kodak EasyShare Z5010 is how every setting is clearly labeled, which means that each new setting shows text 'instructions' on the LCD screen, telling the user which kind of lighting goes best with the setting chosen.  If I turn the wheel to SCN, I see a variety of options and short explainations of what each icon means.I also love that there are some settings I haven't seen on other cameras: including the Children setting (per instructions: 'use for action photos of children in bright light'), the Candlelight setting, the Stage setting, and the Fireworks setting. Loved playing with the different settings to get the best lighting in different conditions.So in thinking of how this compares to my Canon S5IS (which I take almost everywhere), here is the breakdown of how the Kodak stands up:**Feel of the Camera/Ease of use:  The Kodak has the feel of a less expensive camera. From the lens cap to the battery door, it just doesn't feel that durable.  It is light though, which is a good thing, but overall, my Canon wins hands down. Interestingly though, I was actually less 'protective' of this camera than I am of my Canon, so I had no problem handing it off to my nieces and nephews to take a few shots. The kids had a great time with it, and because the settings were so user friendly and the layout of the buttons was so easy to follow, they got some decent shots as well. (B)**LCD Screen: The LCD screen is large but the picture was not great quality, and there's no viewfinder to look through, so the LCD is all you have.  That made it a little tough to be sure that I was getting the lighting and focus right. But the pictures turned out better than I would have thought. So while I'm still having trouble getting used to not having an optical viewfinder, it hasn't been much of an issue. (B)**Panoramic Mode: The Kodak has a very easy Panoramic Mode, much better than my Canon, that shows the previous picture taken so you can line up your shots and 'stitch' them together right within the camera.(A)**Video: I think video quality came out pretty good. The short videos we took came out even better than the still shots actually.  I know there were some complaints from users because they dropped the optical zoom feature from videos but I don't take enough video for this to be an issue for me. (B)**Sharing: Ease of picture sharing is probably this camera's best feature. You can set it up to tag people, then upload the tagged photos to facebook or other sites with the click of a button. This feature was really easy to set up and to use. Had pictures ready for sharing soon after the festivities had ended. (A)**Price: The camera costs about half as much as my Canon. And that is a huge benefit as far as I'm concerned. (A)**Batteries: While Lithium batteries charge quicker, and I think they hold their charge longer, AA batteries are cheaper and can be easier to find if you're out somewhere and see a low battery indicator. My personal preference is AA batteries for just that reason. I know that most camera experts disagree, but it's just my opinion.  The Kodak comes with 4 rechargeable AA batteries and a charger. (A)Overall: It's a great camera for those who just want to enjoy taking and sharing pictures...it's great for online use, it's user friendly, and quality of pictures is fine for posting on Facebook, emailing and printing up to maybe 5x7 or even 8x10 size."

It came with free shipping and the battery recharger. I must say, I took the time to look up the Canon Powershot A630 & A640 mentioned as being in the same price range and could not believe someone was comparing a $500-$600 camera with this one. At least that is the price Amazon listed.<br />This camera has manual settings and automatic settings that are perfect for the vacationer and non-professional picture taker. It is a bit bulky to pack, but it works time and again and never lets me down. Have not have any trouble with blurring or shooting. Found out that although Kodak is not in the camera or film business any more they do honor their warranties on these products.<br />If there is a small drawback it is that there are too many settings and too much can be done manually with this camera. Just turn it on, use the automatic settings to get going, and learn more as you go. I have had several friends think the camera and its pictures puts it in the $750 price category for an on-line purchase. No regrets."

Like the other reviews, the biggest disappointment is how l-o-n-g it takes to process the shot on the memory card so you can take the next shot. If you want to take stills for use for products like cards, magnets, t-shirts etc. then you will be satisfied but if you are photographing people, birds, anything that moves, including ocean shots, bring your patience because you'll stand there and wait... and wait... and wait to take the next shot.I would not recommend this camera for a young family taking pictures of their children for this reason. I went to a birthday party and was so let down.... I should have bought a disposable camera so I wouldn't have missed to many picture-perfect moments."

My last was a DX model that I adore but wanted to upgrade to something a little higher megapixel and faster turn around from picture to picture.  I felt pretty confident with the brand Kodak, so I did a fair amount of research and decided on the M575 after reading good reviews.  I got it for Christmas last year and have gone back to my old DX model after a few months.The camera takes great outdoor pictures - beautiful color, crisp and nice.  But inside the pictures are awful.  The white balance is strange and all my indoor pictures have a yellow tone.  I've tried all of the scene settings and either get a somewhat decent color or tons of blur and red eye.  My old camera had a fast capture so I rarely got blur of movement.  On this one, I can't get a motion picture especially indoors.  I have two kids and I have to move fast to capture a moment.I agree with the other review that talked about expecting a lot sharper picture for the 14 megapixel.  I too get a lot of grainy pictures.The body is nice, easy to hold, nice lens, good screen, pretty easy to point and shoot.  Easy to download pictures, easy to charge and download pictures.  Thought the Facebook feature and easy share email was great. Slim enough to fit in your pocket.So, in essence, it will be a great starter camera for a kid, but if you are looking for a fast shutter to capture action indoors, this isn't it."

It's still in great shape, with whatever small glitches I blame on the refurbished factor. I've never owned a Canon, but I know they are all high quality cameras, but I feel like you can make this Kodak work in wonderful ways.Photos: The pictures from this camera can be awesome if you use the right settings. The SMART mode is helpful especially if you're trying to take a nice quick picture. It has auto focus for macro or landscape, low lighting, etc. But I've found that under the SMART setting, you get really noisy photos under low light. So in order to get a nice shot in that case, you'd have to use one of the Scene modes or the Program mode. I love messing around with the Program mode because you can get all the settings however you want and your pictures can come out great. I would even compare some of the pictures with some DSLR photos. You just have to know how to take them. This Kodak camera came with a mini tripod which I've used on occasion, and it's really nifty! It has adjustable legs, and I've been able to take some beautiful long-time exposure pictures of scenery in low light. I wish I could share some of them here. The hardware is easy to use, however, some people have trouble distinguishing the shoot button from the power button when I ask them to take a picture for me. The flash is bright but good. The screen is very nice, bright and clear - I've had a screen protector on for most of the time, but overall the camera is extremely sturdy. I've definitely dropped it a few times, even on concrete, and there's barely any damage except for tiny scratches.Video: The quality is pretty good, it can record in 720px which is HD. I really like the sound quality from the mic. I've recorded some artists at concerts and it sounds pretty good. Sometimes the focus goes in and out, but there are settings if you want auto, still, or continuous focus, which helps out a lot.Battery life: I haven't had a problem with the original battery. I still use the same one. And like I've mentioned, I've taken this camera to concerts and I've been able to record a good amount of footage on one battery recharge. It's hard to estimate battery life though. I've taken it to many events such as weddings, sporting events, hiking, and usually it'll last me the whole day."

I received the first as a Christmas gift and I believe the purchase price was near $130 at the local big box store. After a year or so of heavy use but lots of care, the camera could be turned on, but immediately turned itself off, and without the telephoto working. The warranty had expired. After switching batteries with no luck and searching the 'net for an answer, it became clear that this is a common problem with this camera, as several reviewers have reported. I also had the same bad experience with Kodak's customer service reps as other reviewers. Of all the companies I've ever dealt with via phone, they are the worst. Enough said. So, why did I buy another M1033? The big positive reason is that this camera is the easiest to use of the other major brands I tried. It's just more intuitive for me. Other reasons are, I bought a great Panasonic Lumix at over $250, dropped it in the water and it was gone. I needed another camera soon, so found a used M1033 on this site for under $60 with a return guarantee if it wasn't acceptable. I was more used to the Kodak than the Lumix and the price was right, so here I am with another one. I would never have paid full price, but a bargain is a bargain, so we'll see if I wasted my money again. Bottom line is this: If you can get one used and at a very low price, it's worth it. It's easy to use and produces good, but not great quality photos. I do not believe it's worth full retail, given the reasons I stated and based on other reviews."

This may have to do with the fact that you're fitting 10 mp worth of data in a 3' space.Now . . . to the design flaw:The flash is right under the shutter.  I bought this camera thinking I was buying another like my M863 (which is being returned to Kodak for repairs--hint, hint) but I kept putting my finger over the flash because it is RIGHT under the shutter.  Sure--I can 'un-learn' how to do that but this is a complete different set up than other Kodak models.Sorry Kodak--this one just isn't for me."
Kodak,Kodak Easyshare M1033 10 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Zoom (Black),20090228,B0012845AA,3,1,2,"on February 28, 2009",ANONYMOUS,"meh, ho hum, mediocre camera","Decent camera for the price.  I'm a previous owner of the cannon digital elph 4mp camera that finally croaked on me recently after 4+ years of use.  The picture quality of the m1033 varies greatly depending on the situation, from absolutely terrible in low light to amazing in brightly lit scenes.The different modes provide a decent amount of control to how the camera takes and processes the image, however the 'smart' mode is absolutely horrid in low light situations and fumbles to find the correct setting to take a picure with, especially if you're not using a flash, something my old cannon would excel in (taking pics in low light w/out flash). The scene and Programmable modes provide deeper control but the menu system seems to get in the way of quickly programming it for a specific shot, for example, there's no quick way to adjust exposure level, iso, macro, etc. which out going through its onscreen menu.Note that there is no manual viewfinder on this camera, so in bight sun, you'll be straining to see the screen to see what you're taking a pic of.This camera is lacking one major feature that was almost a deal breaker, the lack of compression control of the jpegs produced.  Granted my old cannon only had a few settings for this (small, normal, fine, superfine, etc) but to me this is a huge plus for the canon system.  Kodak just uses whatever jpeg compression it feels is best and gets praise for 'only using 1.5mb for and image instead of 3mb for this other camera' (read that in another review).  Which is ridiculous, there are definitely times when you want to be able to control the level of compression in the final jpeg image, sacrificing disk space for a much higher quality image.The easyshare software is bloated and clunky, just like most camera software, it wants to manage every document on your computer for you and wash your laundry and feed your kids.. well guess what kodak, there are some things I've already got software for, so butt out! Or at least give me a lighter version of your software to just facilitate transferring without loading this behemoth program every time, geesh. By default it will nuzzle itself into your systray and stay running on your pc 24-7 just in case you might plug in your camera and assumes that you are too dumb to *gasp* click an icon.  This is another peeve of mine about camera companies and their crap software, consider for a second kodak, that some people *gasp* would prefer to not use your software for picture management and instead use google's picasa or something, in which case, just provide us with the simple option of a transfer only program that would allow us to dump our photos into wherever we want without running your bloatware service in the background hogging up vast amounts of memory.  Granted you can turn off the service and start it manually but there is no way to transfer photos from your camera without loading this giant software suite, which is annoying.Ok, ranted a bit there but if you're looking for a camera that works, takes great pics in well lit situations and is cheap as hell for a 10mp camera, its great.  If you're a cannon user, you'll be disappointed with the quality.Last thing, the HD video feature is AWESOME!  It does have a stabilization feature at a lower rez but not at 720p HD video.  But either way the video works greats, takes great 720p videos, again in well lit situations for best quality.  But the point is, the hd video option is very handy, throw in an 8GB SDHC card and you can take several hours of video on this thing, very cool."

I could not even turn it off.  Removing and replacing the battery solved the repeated problem for a few weeks, but then even that stopped helping.  The camera was inoperable.  In less than two months of use I had a brand new camera that would not work! It does come with a one year warranty, so after an hour long conversation with a Kodak customer service agent who was difficult to understand (I think she was in India), they are taking the camera to service or replace with a refurbished one. I hope it solves the problem, but seeing online how many others have experienced it I fear the whole design may be flawed somehow...In short, my experience has been that it is a great camera when it works, but its unreliability makes it a poor choice..."

I am not sure if it is camera defect but writing to 2 GB flash card is getting slower and slower as more this flash card is filled in. The last negative element is absence of HDR filter.

This Kodak does it.  The auto scene selection in particular is impressive.  You can choose the scenes manually, but taking shots in auto select mode always turns out really good pictures.  The camera is small enough for me to carry in my front pockets and remain barely noticible.  Power on and ready to snap is less than two seconds, the screen is spacious, and the firmware is logical and easy to navigate.

First turn-on was a problem that lens came out but nothing else happened.  Took out battery and put it back in.  Problem solved.  This type of thing has happened twice more but seems to be a software glitch that is solved by taking out battery and replacing it.The pictures are beautiful and in focus.  When you press the button halfway, it takes a short time to acquire focus and then the little bracket in the screen turns green and the camera chimes to let you know it is focussed.  Works great.  I have used it mostly outside and inside with flash.  Photos with flash are a little darker but look very good.  You can adjust brightness if you switch to the programmed mode, but you have to do it every time that you turn the camera on.It is small but not too small so you can get a good grip on it.  I shot a couple of HD videos outside (of my cats) that look good.  They are in 720p and I can play them on my iMac computer with no problem using Quicktime player.  Colors are great and video is sharp.  Only problem is camera takes a second to refocus when you zoom it, but you can zoom during a video.

We wanted a small camera that we could easily fit in a pocket, purse, etc. so that we could have it with us for more of life's events and, therefore, take more pictures.  We've had a larger 'prosumer' model for years that takes great pictures but we rarely had the camera with us for those spontaneous 'in the moment' photo opportunities because the camera was just too big to lug around.  So the size of the Kodak M1033 was one of the primary factors in our purchase.  Of course, the picture quality was also a concern.  With the decent reviews the camera received, we decided to give it a try.In short, we love it!!!  It is small enough to fit in any pocket which means we can carry it with us whenever and wherever we choose.  For our purposes, it takes great pictures.  And it has great features for such a small and inexpensive camera.  I'm sure professionals would (and do) find fault with the picture quality.  However, years from now when I'm looking through pictures I was able to get because I happened to have my Kodak M1033 with me at just the right place and time, I doubt I'll care much if the picture quality wasn't technically on point due to the saturation of grey around the edges when the picture is cropped and magnified 100 X's.  I'll just be glad I got the pic!  Kudos to Kodak for making such a user friendly, solid, simple, and small camera!"

My friends often ask for copies of pictures I take, even if they've taken their own, because of the high quality of the pictures.First, I should say, the zoom button broke--I was able to fix it with a little gentle fiddling of the lens--and sometimes the pictures don't record, though I think this was my own fault for getting foam (don't ask) and rain on the cameraPros:<br />+ value: a great price for what it offers<br />+ size/style: I'd wanted one of the fancy colors, but even the black looks really nice and sleek and doesn't have the cheap feel that some other cameras have; the size is wonderful too, since it fits nicely even into smaller pockets and hands<br />+ picture quality: awesome picture quality, with different settings to fiddle around with; my only complaint is that night pictures aren't always the greatest<br />+ video quality: the videos have great sound and picture quality<br />+ speed: the picture is taken almost as soon as you press the shutter button.  Basically no delay.<br />+ settings: has quite a few settings for taking pictures in different lighting conditions, etc to try out, without being overwhelming. Try out different settings, even if the setting isn't described as ideal for a certain lighting conditionCons:<br />- software: the Kodak software is a mess.  If you are able, try to get by without it or use another program.<br />- video editing: the videos are in .mov files, which is not ideal for me as a PC user; also, the Kodak software is not very good for editing videos and sometimes freezes up with larger files.<br />- screen: some people like the bigger screen, but it was more of an annoyance to me, since it probably uses a bit more battery power than a smaller screen would and because of its size, it seems more prone to scratches; the pictures look /much/ better on the computer than on the LCD screen.Overall, in spite of the software flaws (which don't really have to do with the camera itself), I'd highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great camera at a great price."

Despite being such an expensive camcorder, the Hard Drive Disk Sony model took grainy footage and to put a sour cherry on top, the photos were terrible! I returned the piece of crap. Since the $443 camcorder had such crap quality, I thought about going all in. Let's get an HD camcorder, but we all know that requires a lot of money. Fortunately I found a much better alternative. Kodak M1033! I have reviewed footage from this Kodak camera and I it is 10x better than the Sony camcorder that I had. It features 720HD video capabilities and I must say this is an amazing deal. It totally beats an upscale Sony camcorder AND it takes great pictures. Definitely worth it if you're into making decent home movies.

The image quality is ok, the size is compact, and it's great having HD video capability in my pocket.That being said, there is a serious flaw in the firmware that puts you at risk of losing picture and movie files stored on your SD card, particularly if you are a Mac user.It should be noted that there are also some minor operational issues that myself and others have experienced, most commonly that of the camera locking up on occasion. This has happened to me perhaps 5-7 times over the past few months and is easily remidied by removing and replacing the battery. Another flaw is that now and then, a completed movie is unplayable on the camera, yet is playable on the Kodak HDTV dock or computer software such as VLC.The BIG DANGER, though, is in utilizing a card reader (as many of us do) in order to transfer your pictures to your computer. On a Mac, the 'Finder' (file browser) inserts many hidden files on your SD card, which you can see if you look at the card on a Windows computer or in the Terminal on Mac. These files evidently give the camera MAJOR problems when you insert it back in the camera. However, the problems do not seem to manifest themselves until you shoot a movie. I've had the camera corrupt every single picture and movie on the card through this design flaw. Another time, I got lucky and only about 70% of the files were corrupted.This is a SERIOUS problem that Kodak needs to correct in a firmware update. My Kodak Z740 never had this problem.As a workaround in the meantime, I highly reccommend using a free little utility called CleanUp smb mess, available at [...] . It removes all of the hidden files put on the card by your mac. I keep it in my dock and use it all the time! Once you drag your disk over it's icon and eject it, you won't have any problems with corrupt files. But, should you forget to do so as I have a few times, kiss those precious 'Kodak moments' goodbye!!!"

I currently own a somewhat old Sony 5mp 'prosumer' camera (which still takes very nice photos) and an 8mp Canon DSLR. Since the latter weighs nearly 4 lb. with my favorite lens on it and the former is not exactly compact either, I went shopping for a reasonably good quality and not too expensive pocket camera. After reading some reviews I was interested in a Fujifilm J10, which while inexpensive seemed pretty decent and got good marks for image quality. I treked down to a local Best Buy to check it out. While the J10 does look like a very nice camera for the money, I was not quite enthused about what I perceived as a sluggish response, and the camera buttons seemed a bit clunky. I decided while I was there to look around at other brands and models while I was there. That was when the Kodak M1033 caught my eye. I thought it was a very attractive looking camera. Part of this was due to the fact that it had little in it's finish that would attract finger prints ... something that drives me crazy. Upon picking up the camera I then noticed it was a Kodak and was a little surprized. To be honest, I've not perceived Kodak cameras as being of particular quality or performance. Upon playing with the controls I was immediately impressed with the build quality and the feel of the buttons. Discovering the joystick control ... I was off to the races. Most of the camera operation was fairly intuitive and I found the joystick a much more convinient selection method than the multi-way controls used in most pocket cameras. I was also impressed by the quick responses of the camera ... start-up time, shutter lag, magnification and image scrolling on playback were all quite good, particularly by pocket camera standards. I decided to wait and research the camera some more and then once I found out about the HD video modes with MPEG-4 compression, I decided to give it a try. After several days of using the camera, I'll say that overall I'm fairly impressed with it. The image quality doesn't compare with my DSLR but even though shots in low light are frequently a bit noisy and blurred (again, by DSLR standards), they look pretty good compared to other pocket cameras I've seen reviewed. With 10mp you can afford some blurriness which you'll never see unless you enlarge quite a bit. While full manual modes are not present on this camera, it does give some manual control and has several features that surprized me on this type of camera (spot metering and histogram to name two). On one hand the high ISO settings can make for pretty blotchy and/or noisy images, but again, I've seen far worse in camera reviews of shirt pocket cameras and I must say I'm surprized that these images seem usable even at such high settings. I'm just a bit embarrassed to admit that I've grown accustomed to shooting most of my shots in fully-automatic 'dummy' mode. I can't complain about the results and should I need a little more control, to some extent I have it. All in all I'd have to give this little bugger a big thumbs up."

I have a C series and just got the M1033 and I love it. The toggle is such a nice change. It really is more convenient than the arrows. I also like the clarity of the dials. My pentax was one of the first digitals and was OK. My Nikon Cool Pix is definitely not a fave. It really wasn't that easy to get clear pics. I would definitely recommend the M1033. The video and audio is really pretty clear. I use it for a lot of close ups in taking pictures of jewelry and I actually don't feel like I am working. It is very easy to also take it along because of its size."
Kodak,Kodak Easyshare M1033 10 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Zoom (Black),20090111,B0012845AA,4,12,12,"on January 11, 2009",ANONYMOUS,Little package...BIG punch,"I read various reviews on this item before purchasing it.  I had actually been shopping it for over a month before I caught the bargain I'd been waiting for on AMAZON.  I have always endorsed and recommended Kodak camera products.  I feel they have the best record of quality over time and have never failed to deliver what I have been looking for.  I've never been a big supporter of Sony cameras or HP cameras, just because I feel that they are companies doing more that what they can to go outside their scope of industry and are just looking to get 'a piece of the pie' on other 'hot' terriories.  I have seen the capabilities of some of their products and have always found a Kodak that not only matches the spec, but in many cases supercedes it.  I was a photographer in High School, so I am not very unfamiliar with photography and I hope my review will help you in choosing your next camera.  For the record, I have been waiting a long time to upgrade, my last camera was Kodak CX7530 5.0 MP camera that served me faithfully and continues to do so when I don't use my new m1033.The m1033 is extremely compact that carries a huge screen compared to many like models with similar capabilities.  I love being able to see a picture on the screen and know what I may be missing before I press the shutter.  It also has the Kodak smart capture feature, which allows for the camera to be able to dictate to the user what type of setting to snap the picture in rather than have the user choose from its mulitiple variations.  I have found the smart feature to be accurate for the most part, about 8 times out of 10, which isn't too bad; however it doesn't help to have this feature on when you are trying to snap a picture in 'the moment.'  The screen may look like the picture is coming off blurry or grainy, don't worry, this is natural and once you have pressed the shutter, you will see your picture the way you want it to print out.  The other feature that jumps at you right away is the stabilization feature.  While this particular model does not carry the IS (Image Stabilization) technology, it does have a built-in indicator which tells you how steady the camera was when the picture was taken.  There is a green hand with motion bars for steady, a yellow hand with motion bars for in-between and a red hand with motion bars to let the user know the camera was not steady at all when the picture was taken.  I like the feature, however it was not always accurate and on some occassions (very few) I was perfectly still and yet received a red hand.  At which point I felt that perhaps by resetting it (turning it off and then on again) the system would restore the lens.  Oddly enough, I was right.  This may seem aggravating to most, but unless you are a photo journalist who needs his camera to be ready to fire at any given moment, this shouldn't be too much trouble the one time you may have to do this as the camera loads extremely fast.  Other features include the ability to e-mail a photo from the camera once you dock it or connect it to your computer.  The m1033 also has the Kodak Perfect Touch feature, which basically touches up your pictures immediately after being taken in order to minimize the amount of editing on a PC.  The video shoots extremely well and I was able to view videos at a 720p capacity on a 19' monitor just fine.  If you are desperate to have your PHOTO camera shoot in higher resolution so you won't have to buy a camcorder, then this camera is not for you.  The last feature I was very impressed by was the stitch feature.  This allows you to take a panoramic photo by taking three individual photos and then stitching them together at their seam points.  I thought this was a nice feature for the times when one picture just doesn't say 1,000 words but instead 333.  You'll find this feature particularly handy at football and baseball games as well as other sporting events.  The only thing I will warn you about is that it is intended for still-frames so don't expect to capture action in this mode, you will only be able to get what remained still throughout shoot.The review asks for best out of five stars, but if I had to give it a TRUE rating (best out of 10), this would be an 8.5 out 10.  Excellent point-and-shoot camera with some great features.  It is super-slim and is about the size of a Motorola Q or Samsung Blackjack.  I recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade but doesn't want to spend too much money.  If you have to spend more than $150 on this particular model I recommend you go for the m1093 IS, which is better than the m1033 on some aspects.  No matter which model you go with, you will always find that Kodak does not disappoint."

Since we're talking about cameras here, if a device has say, easy steps to change flash settings, that is no good. The steps themselves are easy, yes, but it is the necessity of steps which faults it.Thus, I may declare that the Kodak M1033 is wonderfully step free. Powering up the camera is a one button affair, no jog wheels to confuse. One button brings up the camera modes and the same one button confirms the selection. Plus, if you do bring up the menu, the camera helpfully hides all of the options that are not used by the active mode. When my father first opened the box on Christmas day, it was completey intuitive for him I use. I'm making a note here, huge success.  (Of course, I did cheat a little by opeining the box the day before and changing all of the initial settings.)The camera does still hold some surprises for power users as well however. Manual picture taking has some fine options and features to be found, including a large ISO range for a camera of this range, useful color options, and for once a surprisingly accurate auto-white balancer.I do however knock the camera down one star for a few complaints I had as a power user. If you are shopping for yourself and consider yourself to be a casual user, then just consider this a five star review and move on.The digital zoomis completely horiffic and will destroy a d picture it is used in, even at low levels. The menu has an option to permanantly turn the digital zoom off. Use it. Although the camera claims to shoot HD video, video in any resolution looks completely unwatchable. And finally there is no option to disable JPEG compression, or change the compression ammount, and as a result, there is a fair bit more artifacts and muddiness as the pixel level than I would care for."

It cannot be reset (by removing the battery, for instance).Meant to be a present, this camera was first used more than a month after the date of purchase.  Since Staples store warranty covers 30 days only, the camera could not be returned for a full refund.Kodak graciously offers to repair it--and they annoy their customers with a call center in India (nothing against India, but a 5 minute phone call easily steals half an hour of your time if you talk to people and their supervisors who have absolutely no clue what you are talking about.  The fact that they don't understand your English and you can hardly decipher theirs does not speed up things, either).  If repair is impossible, Kodak will replace the camera with a REFURBISHED model.According to their policies, Kodak will NEVER give you a new camera to replace one of their defect products.You may want to read the fine print before you trust good old household names like Kodak."

Plus the camera recharges it's flash quicker than any other point-and-shoots that I've owned. PLUS, it runs on 2 AA batteries. A BONUS. I love Lithium Ion batteries, don't get me wrong. But... when you want that security of knowing that anywhere you are, under any circumstances you can put in a fresh set of Alkaline or Rechargeable NimH AA cells, these AA battery cameras are the choice.Had I not been an owner of 3 of these cams, I might not have realized this camera was bad. Make a note of that in the other reviews you read, and if you buy one of these.I wish there was an updated camera with the qualities of this model. I've purchased many, Olympus, Samsung, Canon... All nice cams, but lacking in the basics that make this a really wonderful camera.By the way, it takes REALLY nice photos.

But then...,"I bought a Kodak P850 years ago and loved it.However it eventually developed a known fault -- the power switch became increasingly erratic, until finally it wouldn't boot the camera at all. (Those who are interested can google for the anguished wails of formerly happy customers). I have now called several of the best repair places in the country and they all say the same thing -- we don't work on that anymore because the parts dried up two years ago.<br />I even bought an allegedly &#34;mint, hardly ever used&#34; example from Fleabay to replace my beloved camera. It arrived with the exact same fault as the one I was trying to replace. It went back to the seller; no idea if I'll get a refund or not. It was useless to me as it came. It certainly was not as advertised.There is a way to get into the camera software (by pushing certain buttons in sequence) and read out how many times the shutter has been tripped. The factory service manual can be found online. I don't believe Amazon will let me post the URL here. On p. 27 is the procedure for “Checking the ACTUATION, FLASH, and POWER-ON COUNTERS Without the SERVICE SOFTWARE.” (Google that phrase in quotes and you should get one hit -- the manual). Doing so results in the following counts from my own, now dead camera:<br />Firmware 1.0100<br />Power-on count 2724 (figure many of those are repeat attempts to get it to turn on -- maybe 10 or 15 tries to get it booted for one photo).<br />Total Captured count 8618<br />Strobe count 3372The &#34;mint, hardly used&#34; example, on one of the few times I could get it to stay booted, reported:<br />Firmware 1.0000 (so even older than mine)<br />Power-on count 1109<br />Total Captured count 4843<br />Strobe count 2101So beware. If you buy one of these, claimed new or clearly used, you're operating on borrowed time with no possibility of repair. If you buy used, go through the procedure in that online Kodak service manual to read out how &#34;used&#34; it really is.For me, I give up on Kodak. Never again. I'm looking at a Canon Powershot SX50 HS to replace this.I appreciate machinery that can be repaired and despise the current throwaway mentality. I still have my first SLR camera, a Zeiss Icarex; works fine if asked, which never happens anymore. I have a Nikon F3 that I used professionally and still works, but who uses film anymore? And my daily driver car is 50 years old, has probably 600K miles on it, and is still enjoys factory parts support. I don't want to shop for a new camera every 5 years or so. I just want to take pictures."

I found this camera to exceed most of my expectations.  As a digital camera it performed similar functions to film-type SLR cameras.  The photos I took ranged from close-up facials to very distant landscapes.The zoom feature allowed me to get precise detail of distant objects as far away as 20 miles (such as Mt. McKinnley in Alaska).  When using the zoom feature it is important to mount the camera on a sturdy tripod to prevent shaking.The one thing the camera could have would be a Blue Tooth shutter release.  I found that when taking zoomed-in photos, some had to be re-shot due to using the mechanical shutter release.  I solved that problem by using the timer feature.The Auto-Focus is easy to use and took away any guesswork.My original camera started having an intermittent problem after a couple of years with the On/Off switch.  I would turn on the camera and would be ready to take a picture when the camera would suddenly turn itself off.  I've had cameras (including Kodak) that were without defects for twenty years or more.One good thing was the availability of several accessories such as color filters, wide angle and extra zoom lenses, and an electronic flash."

I had a Canon S2 which I sold after I saw my friend's P850.  Bottom line -- this camera is much more fun to use.  The LCD, while not having the highest resolution, is much better than Canon's 2.0 rotating LCD.  I compare this to the Canon because I used to have the Canon, and that camera is also the standard for comparison.I like the rechargeable battery.  I have the camera dock, and it's great to just put the camera on it and not worry at all about the battery or charging rechargeables.  I bought two extra batteries because Kodak prices them reasonably.The Image Stabilization works great on this camera -- better than the Canon.  It takes longer to focus, however.  The Canon is quick to focus and much more responsive.  For my needs though, it's not an overriding factor.I like to take a lot of pictures without the flash.  However, whenever I turn off the flash, and turn off the camera, the flash is set back to auto.  This is very frustrating.  Maybe I need to research the custom settings and see if that can be of help.I am very disappointed in the movie mode.  It takes good movies, but it doesn't use MPEG 4 compression, like other Kodaks.  It was probably a matter of timing.  I think I read that the successor to this camera will use MPEG 4.  I bought a Kodak 530 at Office Depot on sale for $139 several weeks ago that uses MPEG 4 with image stabilization, and it blows away the P850.3 Stars from me for ultra-zoom cameras is pretty good.  I gave the Canon 1 star for resting on its laurels.  I think much better ultra-zooms are going to crop up in the next year or so.  Kodak's next model looks good, the Sony H5 looks fantastic, and the Canon S4 will have to be a major refinement.In the meantime, I will enjoy the P850.  It's a *fun* camera that is a pleasure to use that takes great pictures."

I absolutley loved it up until about a week ago. Thats when either the image stabilization quit or the auto focus went out. Of course this happened right before my sisters gradution, a major event in my hometown and a vacation. All the pictures taken with zoom are so blurry you can not tell what they are. Without the zoom, there is a haze. I used Kodak's online troubleshooting and answered their questions. After answereing 'yes' to 'When placed on a tripod or flat surface does the picture clear up?'. It then told me 'We are glad we helped fix the problem.' No, you didn't. I did not purchase this camera to have to use my tripod EVERY TIME!!! So I called warranty and the said it would be a minimum of 4 weeks for repairs and shipping! NOT! Im so glad I purchased it at my local Sams Club. They are going to refund my money. I will be going with a Cannon or Sony!"

I was looking for a camera with a big zoom, stabilization, and manual controls. This is perfect!!. The second nite I had it I took a stunning pic of the moon. I am not a photographer, and I have alot to learn. But, it came out great. Was able to zoom it in full screen.Yes the LCD is a bit grainy, but i dont seem to have any problems manually focusing. Inside and outside pics have come out great. Although I do have to take a test pic to find out what setting comes out the best, thats cause im a novice.I dont seem to have the wait time others have mentioned. Video Loads very fast. I did buy a Sandisk Ultra II. Maybe this is the answer, but its the only card I have, and have nothing to compare it to. And Others have also mentioned that the camera shuts off and you have to turn off, then back on. This is true, But it can be set to a longer time, up to 30 minutes. It starts pretty fast, ready to shot within 3-4 seconds. I like the feature to save battery.I gave it a 4 because I never give anything a 5. I figure there is always something better out there that I havent experienced or there will be. I love this camera and would recommend to anyone looking for a big zoom at a good price."

The colors are remarkably accurate and seem to have a kind of glow that I have not seen with other brands.  This is because of Kodak's patented color science software built into the camera.The P850 is simple to use.  It can be used in a fully automatic mode, but also has scene modes for every situation.

It focuses and adjusts the light itself. This sometimes takes a second and the spontenaity of the shot is gone. But this is a choice you make, it doesn't have to do that. I use this camera professionally. It is perfect for shooting my studio models and for my product photography. I don't want a huge complicated camera, its just not me nor has my interest.

I chose this camera for the zoom for sporting events.  The pictures at the zoom range are almost always out of focus because it is so hard to hold the camera still while trying to get an action shot.  Then the down time between shots is so long, forget quick action shots in a row.  Also the delay after pressing the shutter is so long the shot is missed most of the time.  The good thing is the quality of a posed picture is very crisp but again because of the delay, many times eyes are closed due to the flash.  I would never purchase this camera again."

I narrowed it down to either the Panasonic FZ5 or the Kodak P850. The Kodak P850 had the better feature set in my opinion. Pictures are crisp and color is good.Pros:- Live Histogram(I really like this feature)- Good Color and picture quality- Natural controls that you get used to quickly- Excellent feature set- Good Image Stabilization- Manual Focus- Looks niceCons:- Noisy Zoom- Loses focus when changing zoom- Flash too strong at times- DC charging adapter sold separately- Would have like a wrist strap insteadOverall I am happy with this camera.

I received it for my birthday after suggesting that I might be interested in a long-zoom digital camera with image stabilization.  This is my third digital camera.  I liked my 3x Olympus, 3 megapixel but thought I would like the additional features that I just mentioned. To begin, I hate everything about the Easy-Share program. The image stabilization does little or nothing for me.  Even a tripod is not paticularly useful because the camera lacks opportunity for remote shutter release, the camera IS slow, the flash is weak.  In most of the scene modes (and flash), the shutter is too slow for me to hand hold.  The movie mode has great picture and sound but movies can't be burned to DVD for showing on a conventional DVD player.  To me, that means this feature is next to useless.  Controls are too complicated.  About all that I can say for it is that it looks good.  I'm just glad that I still have my Olympus!"

The first couple of months were great, the pictures were good. But then when I got close to the warranty experation I started having trouble. When I called they said I could send it in to be fixed but I would have to pay. Then some time later they told me that they could not fix it because it had corrosion problems. This camera has sat next to my other three cameras as well as next to my computer for the whole time I have had it. It stays in a case except when I take pictures so I have a problem with it getting corroded. Then to add insult to injury they send it back stripped. They kept my battery, lens cap cover, shoulder strap and even took the eye protector off of it not to mention the two dings in it that it did not have when it left my house. I have three cameras all of them 6 years old or older. They all still work and all still look new. I have never been so disappointed in a product. If you are looking for a digital camera I hear wonderful things about Cannon, and I have an old Sony I love."

I was somewhat shy at first of buying a Kodak (not sure why), I usually stay with Fuji or Nikon cameras.  However, I had an upcoming vacation and a desire for a camera with a big zoom factor.  That's when I found a great deal on a Kodak P850 with the 12X Zoom and Image Stabilization.  Before using the camera I did some research and found out about the firmware update that improves shutter lag time and focus time.  I downloaded this and followed the directions from the Kodak website and it was an easy fix.  I would suggest this to anyone with a P850.  I also ordered an extra battery and an extension tube so that I could used a lens hood and 52mm filters on the camera.I took the camera with me on my trip to Lancaster County, PA and got some great shots.  I used it on Auto mode, Aperture Priority mode, Landscape Scene mode, Sports/Action Scene Mode, and Backlight Scene mode all with good results.  I thought detail and color in the pictures was very good. Shutter lag was not bad, and battery life was good.  I have posted a few of my images from the trip in the gallery.  We'll have to see what the longtime verdict is on the P850 but for now I am pleased and have a new (and better) opinion of Kodak."

I must start by saying I LOVE every feature about this camera. It's also a video camera, battery life etc... BUT the first one I had lasted 2 months before some of the pictures that were turning out had black lips on people (WEIRD HUH?)  looked as if someone had put black marker on the lips.  So I traded for another, thought there was no way this could happen again, and on the 2nd camera I could not get it to turn off, so after a day I returned it for another P850, still in hopes that the black lips would not come back.  So I have had the camera for 1 year and 3 days and sure enough last night the black lips are back!  So I printed out the pics from the first camera and this camera and took them in to Sams club where I have purchased now 3 of these and because I was 3 days over my 1 year mark they referred me to my extended warranty.  So I would love to know if anyone else has had this problem or had theirs repaired for the same reason??????  I'm scared to death they won't be able to fix it and I will get stuck with a refurbished camera.  But other than the black lips I love everything about the camera, I must since I have returned the same model over and over!!!! Not this time!!!!!"

I started out in the digital world with a Nikon 950 (2 MP) and I used that one for years and years...it finally got sand in the swivel mechanisism and has never been the same since  :( I decided that this is the camera I wanted because I didn't know if I would use an SLR because I was still an ameteur.  I research many cameras, if not daily, close to it.  I still can't seem to find a better camera.  The thing I liked about this camera was that it had plenty of mode scenes to choose from because I was still pretty intimdated by the Priorty, Aperature and shutter sequences.  Well, I'm not any more...esp since I've had this camera.  I can adjust just about anything to suit the lighting and I rarely, if ever use the flash anymore! The menu features are easily assesible and intuitive to use as well ( A good feature to have!) As a matter of fact, I've looked into a full-blown SLR cameras and can't seem to find one that really compares to this!  The fact that this camera can be upgraded with an external flash and wide-angle and telescopic lenses makes this a nice fit.My husband and I travel a lot, esp since he is in the military.  This camera was affordable which is more than I can say about most of the digital SLRs.  5 MP is more than enough for your average Joe, printing out 4x6 prints, and it does so, quite nicely.  It does make pretty 5x7s, and I haven't yet decided on the perfect 8x10 yet...just to see how it looks.  Most people aren't making those kinds of prints and having a 10 MP camera doesn't really matter unless you are taking pictures of the bug's warts on the tree on the mountain 2 miles in front of you, which is the only reason I didn't decide to go with the P880.  They are basically the same camera, with less scene modes and more MP.The battery life is great on this camera, too.  I took it with me to Hawaii on vacation and I charged the battery 3 times in 14 days.  I used the camera every day, showed my pictures off, reviewed them several times and left the dang thing on in my bag on the flight by mistake.  I still have full charge on the battery after nearly 10 days of not using it.  This camera has taken some quite nice pictures and it sure beats having a digital point and shoot.  I can actually look into the eye piece as if I am using an actual film camera.  I love that it has an anti-shake in the camera as well, since I love to use the macro functions to make pictures of bugs and plants and that just wouldn't be possible to do unless you had a tripod...but that's impractical if you are pressed for time when you are with a tour group.  I'll bet I can make better pictures of lightenin' bugs with this camera than my aunt did using a tripod with her old film SLR (but alas, there are no lightenin' bugs in Germany that I have seen :(I never give 5 stars to products because there will always be something else that is better.  I simply can not in good conscience give this camera 5 stars!  There are some limitations to this camera.  The recycle time on the camera tends to be slow and when using the movie feature the recycle time is nearly triple!  If you have patience, then you're a better person than I am!! HAHA, it was more of an annoyance than anything, but you will get over it.  I  found that setting the review mode off while taking pictures does make the camera recycle a bit faster and that is permanently off on my camera at the moment.  I have used a friend's Canon Digital Rebel camera and the recycle time is much faster (I actually considered trading my Kodak because of that very reason!)  I don't know about you, but I would rather not miss that one perfect shot because the camera is too slow!!!  There are features on the Kodak that Canon just doesn't offer and it is a bit more complicated to learn than this was.No matter what kind of camera you decide to get, I seriously recommend that you go to a brick and mortar store and take a few test shots and feel the camera in your hand.  I don't recommend buying one in the store though, you're probably going to end up paying way too much for it.  You should definately have a few cameras in mind before you go.  Don't let the salesperson intimidate you.  This is a huge purchase and one you're likely to be stuck with it for a few years.  Definately check other websites to see other reviews, too.Ok, I'll step off my soapbox now...IN SUMMARY: pretty good camera, anti-shake, macro modes, zoom feature, scene features, 5 MP, upgradable lenses and external flash, exceptional battery life, slow recycle times, research before buyingRECOMMEND:  Yes, especially if you want to upgrade to a full-blown digital SLR sometime later in the future."

Rather than wait for any problems, the first thing I did was download the firmware update from Kodak. [...]  You unzip the file then put the update back on the SD card and the camera automatically reacts to the update.  All done in 1 minute.  The camera hasn't given me any problems.I like its light feel and it fits comfortably in the hand.  It is a very quiet and smooth running camera.  Focusing isn't all that fast, but the image quality is good and the HD video is decent but the zoom will blur out on occasion on distant shots.  If anything it looks like a soft focus edit, though unintentional!  The many features are helpful but I shoot mostly in manual.  The exposure rate in on the high side so I tone it down -3.  There is some barreling or fringe lens shadowing on the edge of pictures.  The infinity depth of field is nice and sharp, but the lower end doesn't blur out the background as much as I would like.  The battery life is excellent and the recharging is simple by just plugging the camera via AC cord into the wall socket.  Will take over 200 pictures on one charge up!  The 3 inch LCD is nice and big, easy to use.  It seems that that the image stablization works (I do have IS on) because I have a very shaky hand and it would have shown in the pictures.  My past not using Kodak had to so with their poor IS only working in the long zoom format.No, the camera isn't made as solidly as a Canon or Nikon but you are only paying about one quarter the price!The camera is very simple and user friendly.  It does the job and if you know your photography you can get more out of it.  It is a good camera but not excellent."

I changed my mind.  A solid one.  After a hundred years in the business, they should know how to design a camera.  I guess they forgot.  Lots of pixels and lots of features alone do not make a good camera.  The core features need to work well and they don't.Zoom is jerky.  It zooms, overshoots, stops where it wants which is too far,  You zoom back, it overshoots and now it's too wide.  It's near impossible to quickly get a shot framed how you want.Even when you make the focus zone small, it acts like it focused on your subject but changes its mind at the last instant and gives you a blurry picture.  A million or a billion pixels make no difference if they're all blurry.Two-tenths of a second is what they claim.  Push the button and get a picture.  Well, depends on how you measure it.  Add in a couple seconds for fighting with the zoom.  Add a second or two for it to try and fail to focus.  Another half-second to pop up the flash.  A second or three to store the image in the memory.  Yes, I got the fastest Kodak-certified card I could find.  Actual picture-taking time is more like 5 seconds per shot.  I've lost a lot of shots.  It's not a true SLR.  It's not a point-and-click.  It's a point-and-wait camera.File formats.  They us a proprietary format for their RAW files, not TIFF.  They use Quicktime for movies.  If you want to really use the camera, you have to buy more software.  They must have some marketing tie-in to try and sell software.  I don't like it.  The Easyshare software also does its level best to sell you their online printing and online image sharing garbage.  No, I want none of that.George Eastman is probably turning in his grave because Kodak is unable to make a halfway decent lens cap anymore.  Hard to attach, hard to remove except when it pops off by itself at every opportunity.Bottom line, a lot of features for the money.  However, many features do not work that well.  I had an older CX Kodak digital.  Less pixels, less features.  It took acceptable pictures quickly and rarely out of focus. This is not a professional-grade camera.  It's too complicated and slow for a point-and-shoot.  Ergonomics are not good.  Not easy to hold.  Zoom buttons poorly placed.  Needs two hands to use but too small for that.  It points out how much work is yet to go before digital is a good medium.  Makes me want to dust off my old Pentax and go back to film."

We chose the Z1015IS to fill this purpose.  I find this camera to be easy to use, fast enough to get shots of my toddler, and it takes nice video.I found that the auto focus was a bit slower than my older Z camera, so I changed the auto focus to the center of the view field and this helped a lot with focus speed.Many speak of incredibly slow processing time, but we have not had this issue. This may be because we got a SanDisk Extreme III high speed memory card 8 G (this size chip is great too because you can shoot tons of high def pics and take video and never run out of room).I really like that you can zoom in and out when using video mode, something my old camera did not do.  The large view screen is nice too.The 15X optical zoom is AWESOME! I recommend getting a small portable tripod that will fit in your camera bag so you can use the zoom where ever you are.My wife is an all AUTOMATIC photographer and she is happy with this model.The only real cons are that this model cannot use standard batteries like my old one, so I bought two right off the bat to have a backup.  They are rechargable, and these two have covered us for all uses.  Get a charger with a car port too.The other con is the lens cap.  Its a bit easier to pop off than I'd like.  However, this has not impacted the camera or its use in any way.  Dont worry about this.All in all, tons of camera for the $$."

I would recall the camera to have it fixed from its horrible flaw. Movies are just as important in this field. If you buy a Camera with 'movie' it better work right out to the buyers.

Strengths include: * Most important, it takes wonderfully sharp, well-exposed pictures.  I have been amazed at how consistently good the photos are.<br /> * Wide zoom range is a big advantage.  This is my first superzoom, and I did not appreciate how much extra flexibility it gives you when composing a shot.  The Z1015 zooms in and out pretty fast, but I find I can tap lightly on the +/- control to get what I want.<br /> * Image stabilizer works surprisingly well, even at extreme telephoto (although it cannot work miracles)<br /> * Layout of controls is more convenient and intuitive than on any digital camera I have used.  Playback, delete, flash, focus options, and self-timer can all be set quickly with one button.  A lot of in-camera help is also available if you need it, which I find handy to remind me what the many Scene modes do.<br /> * Electronic viewfinder shows just what the camera sees.  It can be used in any light, gives info about the settings as well as the image, and saves power.  I now use it most of the time, saving the LCD just for playback.<br /> * Comes with a rechargeable lithium battery and charger.  I find the battery lasts about 125-150 shots, so I carry a spare battery.  It charges quickly in about 2-3 hours.<br /> * Shooting modes all work well.  My favorite is P, which gives good control over flash, exposure adjustment, and focus modes if I want them, letting the camera set the rest.<br /> * Ssurprisingly light in weight despite the large, superzoom lens, due to the plastic (not metal) body<br /> * Very quietComments about weaknesses (and rebuttals to those mentioned in other reviews) include: * Very few weaknesses.  Many of those mentioned in other reviews suggest that the writer did not do much research before their purchase or did not take the time to read the instructions.  The Z1015 can be used as a simple point-and-shoot, but it is not really an entry-level camera.  It has a lot of features.  Investing a couple of hours in learning about them really expands what you can do with it.<br /> * Processing speed is not a problem with current firmware.<br /> * LCD screen is indeed a bit grainy, but adequate.  I find that pictures look much sharper when viewed on a computer or digital TV later than they do on the camera's LCD.<br /> * Lens cap does pop off easily, but I think it was designed that way so that if you turn on the camera without first removing the lens cap, the extending lens pops the cap off harmlessly without damaging the internal zoom lens motor.<br /> * Warning: the Kodak 1348762 camera case that Amazon says many customers buy along with the Z1015 is actually NOT big enough for this camera.  After returning it, I bought a Tamrac 5693 case, which is well-made, compact, inexpensive, and accommodates the camera and an extra battery perfectly.In sum, I have found the Z1015 to be a remarkably versatile camera that makes me look good as a photographer--well worth the mid-range price.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone interested in a high-quality superzoom digital camera."

Detail was missing; everything looked as if there was a bit of fog.  The look was as if taken with an old uncoated lens.  How Schneider ever got involved is a mystery.Indoor flash pictures were better--probably because reflected light was more direct.  But since most people will buy this for the long zoom outdoors, this is a loser. All those megapixels just make for a soft picture that is very large.I returned this camera--Amazon's affiliate seller was fast and courteous--and bought a Canon PowerShot SX110IS.  It has fewer bells and whistles than the Kodak, but a fantastic lens.  Well worth it.FOLLOW-UP, a few months later--the Canon takes very good pictures for the price, but it is a special kind of hell to shoot in daylight outdoors.  I will never buy another camera without a viewfinder."

Based on reviews I thought this one would be good.  It was important that my new camera would be easy to figure out.  I don't have time to read a huge book of instructions.  I wanted a camera that I could essentially just pick up and use right away.  At the same time, I wanted a camera that would be capable of taking very high quality images once I had learned more about photography.I have had the camera for about three months now and overall I have been extremely happy with it.  I was able to start using it right away, and even in the automatic mode it takes wonderful photos.  The set-up is very user friendly and it is easy to figure out additional features.  Since I am a busy musician I haven't had time to look into all of the details of making professional quality photos yet, but so far everything I have done has worked very well.  The quality of the photos is excellent.I only have one complaint concerning the camera and that concerns taking videos.  I'm not sure if these problems have anything to do with my lack of knowledge or if these sorts of problems are standard regarding videos taken from digital cameras.Here is the problem:  I have set up the camera in order to take videos of myself fiddling and sometimes the image goes in and out of focus.  It appears a bit blurry.  Also, the camera makes a strange noise (sort of a clicking or grinding sound) at times while recording the video that can be heard when the video is played back.  I find that extremely annoying.  You can see an example of a video that I made with my Z 1015 IS that I uploaded to You Tube and you will see the blurriness and hear the sound I'm talking about.  Go to: [...]My goal isn't to take professional quality videos using this camera, but I was a bit disappointed with the clicking sound.  Some more information for you:  I ordered a set of equipment to use with my camera from Kodak and among the items included in the set was a camera bag.  I wanted to make sure that the bag would fit my camera so I contacted Kodak by phone.  The woman I spoke with assured me that the bag would fit my camera.  Once I got the bag in the mail all I had to do was look at the bag to see that there was no way it was big enough to fit the camera.  I was disappointed that I was given wrong information over the phone by a Kodak representative.  Having said that, the remainder of the items in the set were cheaper than if I would have bought them separately.In this review I've tried to tell you about both the good and the bad I have experienced from this item.  In buying this camera I liked helping to support an American company.  I think this is an excellent camera overall.  I am so happy with it that I am planning to buy a subcompact camera from Kodak in order to have something small to take with me on trips."

But this one had a 15x zoom (vs 12x on the 812) 28 mm lense AND could shoot in RAW.  MAN what a disappointment!  In manual, you can NOT set your aperature.  It give 2 options (one high and one low) and then is will often SWITCH while you are shooting!  I'll be shooting along and suddenly, black image.  I look and it has switched to like a 10 F stop!  It is also very difficult to set the ISO, Shutter speed and aperature...the light bounces around and passes waht you are trying to set.  you have to REALLY baby it to stop where you want it.  Over all, I HATE this camera.  Just can't afford another now since I just got this one a few months ago.  I shoot a LOT as a hobby....landscapes, animals, etc and am very frustrated with it.  I also like the 'Star' effect on lights with night shots on the 812.  Nothing doing with this one.  Just plain bland lights.  That was my signature on night shots.

I end up with a lot of photos of their backs or not smiling, etc.I'd keep the camera if I already knew how to use the PASM manual more (only if it really made a difference in processing speed), but then again, it's supposed to be a 'Point-and-Shoot', too.

The software does not work but you can use a 1gb SD card in the camera and then put the card in your computer and save the pics.  Win 2000 does not see SD cards larger than 1gb but who cares?  A 1gb card lets you take 266 high def jpeg pics. I taped a small pill bottle to my camera strap so I have a spare 1gb card and battery handy at all times.  Works great. I never miss a shot.  Regarding the software, I have another digital camera and I did not bother to load the software for it either.  Photoshop works so much better to edit pics.  And who needs all this EasyShare crap anyway?  If you don't know how to attach a pic to an email so you can share it then you probably won't figure out how to use EasyShare anyway.This is the most fun camera I have ever owned --- Love It"

First thing is, when you take it out of the box, if it feels a little cheap, well don't be surprised.  But is it cheap?  Well, yes and no.  I'll reiterate this a couple more times in this review, but the price is really good for this camera.  But what everyone really wants to know is--how does it perform?  The answer to that is a mixed bag.<br />First, the push-to-capture speed is pretty fabulous for a digital camera.  Meaning that you've got less of a chance to miss that perfect shot.  But what if a MORE perfect shot comes along oh... in the next 2-3 seconds or so?  Well too bad.  Because the processing/saving to memory time of this camera isn't great.  Yes, I've got the latest firmware update (which it came with, but I checked anyway), and I have a class 4 SDHC card, so it's no slouch.  However, the speed did prompt me to order a class 6 card in hopes that will help my cause of taking more than two pictures in ten seconds.  Of course, there's always the burst feature... which isn't all that quick, either.<br />So there's some bad for ya, how about some good?  Well, this camera, generally, takes great photos.  With the thing in one of the manual-oriented modes, jpg on fine and sharpness enabled, wow, very nice pics from a camera with this price tag.  What else?  Well Kodak just upped the ante with their Z980 with the 24x zoom (for $100 more), but the 15x zoom this baby sports is still really, really nice.  What about the focus when you get in that close?  Again, and unfortunately, the answer is it's a mixed bag.<br />Yes, the manual mode is great for a point and shoot, and it does allow you to manually focus... sort of.  Meaning that if you can get it to basically focus in on your subject, then you can refine the focus and make the pic come out better.  But the manual focus is very, very basic.  Those expecting to use this as some sort of replacement for a more expensive DSLR camera... think again.  But then again, you're never going to get the manual focus capabilities from a point and shoot that you get from a DSLR.  Period.  So in a way, you can't fault Kodak for giving it their all.<br />The wide angle is nice, but I wish it were wider (the Z980 takes it to 26mm, this one clocks in at 28mm)<br />The battery life is respectable, especially for the zoom you get, but I wish they would have included a separate charger so you didn't have to charge the battery IN the camera (I already ordered one).<br />Another thing?  For this price you get an HD camcorder (it can zoom while filming).  Yes, the quality isn't the best, but it's still in high resolution, and better than any other digital camera movie mode I've ever used... and it's still CHEAP.  Forget buying that HD camcorder (I'm selling mine now), and just use this.The bottom line:<br />For the beginner to intermediate photographer, this thing is going to take care of almost, if not all, of your needs.  Beyond intermediate, you have to start considering the compromises you're going to be making for the price (but this is something anyone who has ANY photography skills should realize).  This thing is CHEAP.  Meaning that you could buy this just for the interim until you can afford a DSLR, and in the end really not lose much money, AND have a great point and shoot camera to use for more basic, everyday things.  All in all, highly recommended.Oh, except for FedEx.  They've delivered TWO packages to me in a year and a half, and I've had issues both times.  UPS?  They've delivered every other package (and we're talking quite a few).  How many problems?  Zero."

It's kodak raw format! Not actual raw!! So I am assuming you need the kodak software to work on those! Completely defeats the purpose of raw :(True, the pictures are not a very good quality at night as other cameras, so don't shoot at night! :) or just deal with it. Something about some chip that's meant for that and some cameras just don't have very good ones to begin with like this one. Chances are most people use this camera for snapshot purposes, not professional photography. The graininess won't show up on your 4x6s. It's sufficient quality for everyday use. The great thing is it shoots in RAW.. I still haven't figured out what to do with it, but from talking to photographers RAW has its perks. I like being able to edit photos slightly on camera as well as crop them. The autofocus is pretty good also. I was testing that whole out of a moving car theory. While on roadtrip we were passing by some forestie looking thing off the freeway, so I zoomed all the way in and took a few shots. A couple of the pictures turned out really sharp! Crappy quality due to zooming so much(come on, no camera is really meant to take great pictures while zoomed all the way), but sharp. Don't know.. it's fine for me. If you want a camera that shoots raw, has all the multiple settings, good autofocus AND shoot well at night, go spend a couple grand on a professional one but if you want to be able to just spend $250, then quit complaining that it's not the best thing in the world. I hang around a lot of photographers and know that their equipment is ridiculously expensive, so wanting to spend this much you have to sacrifice something!<br />When it was delivered the mail person just left it by my door, which I wasn't happy with since I lived at an apartment building and my door was right next to the outside door. But whatever, that's not these guys' fault."

There are a few good points: the zoom is great and the camera takes good quality pictures with plenty of settings for both the novice and the professional.  It also comes with a rechargeable battery.  That's were it ends.  The camera has a processing feature that slows this thing up big time.  After every picture, the camera processes the photo.  After taking 4 pictures, the camera locks up in 'Processing' mode to finish processing the photos onto the memory card.  This gets very frustrating when you are trying to capture the perfect picture of the kids in various activities (like their first trip to Disney!).  Also, on the action setting, the camera needs to charge after every picture, resulting in a 30 second delay.  I would not recommend this camera to anyone - I'm returning it and looking for something that doesn't lock up."

The zoom feature is available while in the video mode which was what I was looking for. The sound is recorded in stereo and is good although it's compressed. Kodak using .MOV (QuickTime codec). The 720p widescreen video is quite impressive and you can film up to 29 minutes, if you have the memory. I find making videos with digital cameras convenient and easier than using a camcorder.<br />The picture quality is excellent too and the smart capture mode works well. It is true that there is a delay in processing the photos as another reviewer mentioned but this is not a problem for me. There may be a firmware upgrade for this in the near future. You can avoid this by using the program mode according to another reviewer.<br />The Z1015 IS may be a better value then the lower model Z1012 IS as the Z1015 IS comes with a rechargeable battery and charger. The Z1012 does not. Also the Z1015 has a 3 inch screen compared to 2.5 inch screen for the Z1012. Lastly, the zoom is 15x compared to 12x for the lesser model.<br />I purchased the Easyshare camera dock which works well with this camera and is very convenient as it's always connected to my computer. It also works as a charger too.<br />One minor complaint. The screen could be of higher resolution like I've seen on the Panasonic models but that's about it. For the price, this is an excellent camera.<br />Update (Oct 12, 2008): Kodak has a 1.02 firmware update that addresses the slow processing speed when in Kodac's smart mode. I've updated my camera but don't see any significant difference.<br />Update (Nov, 2008): Kodak has updated their firmware again with version 1.03. This takes care of the processing delays. A Big improvement.<br />About the video: This camera does not film with stereo sound although the manual and online user guide shows two microphones. Zoom up on the photo here on Amazon and you will see two holes next to each side of the lense. These are the mic holes. Well, my 1015 comes with only one mic on the right side (if facing the lense). I called Kodak and they confirmed that this model records in mono. They have since updated their manual online but not the user guide. The Z1012 records in stereo but I think the Z1015 has higher quality sound (less compression)than the Z1012. I'm a little disappointed but this camera is excellent and most people should be very pleased with both the photo and video quality."

Jpeg images are fine also, although RAW is superior because of uncompressed files. Either way the images are full-colored (no-one does color like Kodak), clear, dynamic and detailed. I haven't tried the video functions.The RAW capability is the great strength of the camera and also a source of some weakness. DO NOT USE THE AUTO MODE (or SCENE MODE)if you intend to take several shots in rapid succession. In these modes the camera takes an inordinate amount of time to process the shots. The camera takes time to apply Kodak's Perfect Touch editing to the shots. It is not defeatable in Auto and Scene modes. I use the P mode. Perfect Touch is not applied here. In P mode the camera takes a bit longer with RAW than it does with jpeg in writing to the card.Another drawback to RAW is that few programs read the Kodak RAW files from the Z1015IS. Kodak's own Easyshare software that comes with the camera does. Personally I don't like the software--too basic and clumsy for my taste. Irfanview, a free editing program, does read and edit Kodak Z1015IS RAW files and allows you to save in lossless TIF or BMP, along with jpeg and other types. My hope is that Adobe and others will soon add this camera to their list of readable RAW files.I already had a 12 times optical zoom camera (the Z1012, a fine camera itself), so the 15 times zoom was not a big attraction for me--the RAW was and it has proved to be a real winner in image quality. Anyway, the 15 times zoom works as intended. There is occasionally a bit of purple fringing, but it is not noticeable on normal-sized prints (up to 8.5x11). Macro focusing distance is moderate.Ease of use is excellent. The buttons are well located and handy to manipulate. You can change exposure, flash compensation and other functions quickly and easily. The grip is very convenient. It has a viewfinder and the LCD is large and of very good quality. With moderate flash and LCD use I got about 300 shots off the provided rechargeable battery. The battery recharges in the camera via the provided external power connection--reasonably quick and handy.In summary, the camera does what I want and does it beautifully--produce first-rate photos. I have posted a large number of large-sized photos at [...] Feel free to visit there to see what the camera is capable of. It is easy to use, reasonably-priced and produces first-rate photos. I heartily recommend it.P.S. November 2, 2008.  Automatic application of Kodak's Perfect Touch editing to every picture in the Auto mode is what slows down the write time for the camera in Auto mode (it doesn't happen in the other modes). Kodak has issued a firmware update (1.03) for the camera that now lets the user disable this feature. With the Perfect Touch disabled the camera is very fast in writing in Auto mode.  I imagine that new cameras will come with this firmware installed.  If not, just visit Kodak's web site to download it for free.Adobe has updated their RAW plugin to include the Kodak Z1015 IS in the cameras covered."

It's rare that a company listens to their customers, and I was impressed to hear of their firmware patch.This camera seems to be end all, nicest Z series camera produced, and Kodak is flaunting very fast capture speeds. They do however leave out a detail that will surely convince you, as it has me, to return your Z1015: For every 4 to 5 pictures you take in smart-scene, there is a 20-50 second pause for the Kodak Perfect Touch post-processing...let me repeat that, you take 4-5 pictures and then the camera locks up completely for a half minute (using RAW files), up to almost a full minute if you're using jpg compression. Call Kodak about it and they'll tell you that this long delay is 'normal,' that a firmware upgrade is coming, and that you should 'return your camera for repair.' This camera is a disaster and Kodak needs to pump out a major Firmware upgrade eliminating the post-processing. I was a fan of the Z series, having owned a Z612, and Z712, and recommended the Z812 to my mother as an easy to use, point-and-shoot camera. They are all excellent, fast cameras. The Z1015 is a major, substantial downgrade. It's no longer fast, in fact it is downright SLOW, thus making it a loser in the point and shoot field.When using the PASM manual settings, you can skip the post-processing freeze. Only Automatic and all scene setting modes (everything that makes the camera point-and-shoot), are affected by the processing lock-up."

For just a few dollars more I was you get a larger LCD screen which is really nice, and a few other features. I had read reviews prior to my purchase of the Z1015 that talked about the processing time after taking the pictures. I noticed it with the Z1012 when I was in the store, and felt that I could deal with the issue. However when I got my Z1015 from Amazon and started to use it, it was really annoying. Although many reviews said that the free update that Kodak offers for the camera didn't do much I decided it was worth the try. It was more than worth it. No more processing time issues. I was able to shot over 20 pics back to back with no problem. The update also revised a portion of the smart capture mode. All and all this is an amazing camera that takes wonderful pictures honestly. I would highly recommended. It's light weight and easy to use, and I didn't even mention the zoom.

It is a great camera especially for outdoors shots.  I was able to stand on the sideline of my son's high school football games, snap random shots (not really focusing on anything in particular) and then zoom/crop the shots for some spectacular images.  I've uploaded some of those under the Z710 review.But, I was ready to upgrade since the trusty old Z710 wasn't great indoors at the basketball courts.  I could never figure out the PASM settings so that I captured the fast action in dreadful gym lighting.  I actually broke down and ordered a digital SLR from another retailer and gave it a try for a good month.  I was surprised that the results weren't that much better than the Z710 so I have returned it.Today, I headed off to try the Z1015 and I was very happy.  The firmware upgrade on Kodak eliminates the wait time between shoots and if you turn off the automatic preview after each shot, you cut down on more time.  I have just a 2MP memory card in it and I think that is slowing it down a bit, too.However, tonight I played around with the camera.  While sitting on my couch, I used the 15X optical zoom to zoom in on ornaments on the Christmas tree.  Then, I cropped them further.  Was I shocked!  I only have the Christmas tree lights on and the images are stunning.  You can see the detail as if I were standing right next to the tree (the couch is about 12 feet away from the tree).For the regular photographer, this is a great camera.  If you are considered a digital SLR, you might want to give this camera a try first.  I would never have bought it but my older version Kodak just couldn't achieve good pictures in poor lighting conditions.  This camera's higher ISO capability just might solve my dilemma.  We'll find out...between 3 sons, we have 6 games in the next week.  I'll post an update after I test my new Z1015 at the courts!"

Takes outstanding pictures.  My son loves the camera and that is something coming from a 17 year old.  I read all I could about inexpensive digital cameras and realized the best buy was the Kodak Z1015IS.  Most of the problems listed for this camera are operator headspace and timing.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.

The camera firmware is 1.03 version, very fast autofocus and amazing automatic mode (smart scene). You cannot use another lenses or filters yet, because it don't have any thread. The jog dial was moved to the left side of the camera and I believe that the original position in front of the shooter is the best position. You have only two aperture options that depend of the zoom used, always one of them is the half of the other.The panorama mode is a very strong utility. The manual focus isn't the best but is very good. The camera's ccd is very sensitive and you can take photos in iso 80 with poor light. I prefer manual mode but the automatic modes are very strong. The histogram is very useful and the 2 seconds delay shoot is perfect when you must take a photo with big aperture, without flash and slow velocity. It's a very recomendable product. You must buy a high capacity memory (4GB or more)."

I haven't tried the burst mode. I'm still playing with the Scene Mode settings and find the full automatic setting to be perfectly fine in most cases. In the Scene Mode under Museum without flash or sound it works great indoors for the Christmas Light Photos. And yes, the video is mono. But, I think it sounds fine for regular fidelity videos.<br />  Overall I'm really happy with the camera. I can hold onto it without much trouble and keep it safe and stable without fear of it slipping out of my hands due to its size. I had an old DC-280 1.2 mega pixel camera and this new camera continues to impress me with all of the configurable auto-settings and the manual settings.<br />  Definitely an enthusiasts camera. The Kodak software takes getting used to and it's not the best. But, what a camera for the money."

It was slow to operate, IS didn't work well, and it's auto mode selection was very bad.  But I upgraded to 1.03 and it seems like all these problems have gone away.I am not a digital camera geek so I don't have anything to say about image quality.Here are a few minor issues:<br />Video is captured in Quicktime.  Most PC users will not have a Quicktime editor.<br />Screen/view finder is turned off until image is processed or button is pressed.  So if you take a pic and you have to press a button (trigger, zoom, etc) to turn the screen back on.  So it does have very good back to back pic taking speed but is not really friendly about it.<br />The manual mode controls do not allow one handed use.  The adjust wheel is on the left hand side.  Also it doesn't feel all that intuitive.I am very happy with the camera and would recommend it provided the user doesn't plan of using manual often.Great - lots of feature for the price.Update: Jan 2013.  Still working great after several tens of thousands of pictures.  I have abused this camera and everything still works as new.  Too bad Kodak is no more."

Because she is a techno-phobe, with all that implies about willingness to go beyond picture-taking to selecting & deleting pictures, hooking the camera up to a computer, even change the batteries, there has needed to be support.

It had to be inexpensive and small enough to leave in the glove compartment, and I wouldn't fret over it if I dropped it. High end features weren't needed. This fit the bill very well.<br />Like almost any camera, rechargeable batteries are a must-have. The AA batteries meant that the camera was a little larger, but I already had a lot of 'precharged' Eneloop batteries and a good charger. This allows me to keep it in the car with a 2nd pair of spares almost indefinitely and expect to have charged batteries.Pros:<br />Inexpensive.<br />Takes good pictures in most cases except low-light.<br />LCD is very nice at this price point.<br />Flash is actually decent for this price point.<br />Makes use of the tons of Eneloop AA batteries that I already had.Cons:<br />The battery cover is pretty flimsy. I'd expect it to eventually break if I kept opening it, but with the eneloop batteries and a 'large' SD card, that's not so often.<br />I didn't install the software, but it locks up my computer for quite a while when connecting to one PC (actually, some other peripherals do too). I just want it to show up nice and neat like a USB drive. On another computer it's much more care-free. The problem computer is from work computer it may be due to settings there.<br />Low-light photos are pretty bad, but that's expected at this price point. I don't really need those though for my specific purpose, so that's a very minor con."

The problem was with the batteries (I tried a different brand), or perhaps it was with the battery compartment's latch. The latch must be fiddled with--carefully--before it will firmly snap into place. The drain on the batteries is still alarmingly fast, though. I thought I wouldn't mind that too much, but it's been a big drawback.This was my original review:I was so impressed by all the positive reviews that I pretty much disregarded the bad ones. What a mistake. In total I had taken no more than a dozen pictures, if that, when the Kodak batteries that came with the camera died. I tried using alkaline batteries (which was supposed to be okay to do), but when the camera still did not turn on, I took them right out. Then, stupid me, I spent even more money buying Kodak rechargeable batteries, thinking this would solve the problem. It didn't. The camera still will not turn on. I'm beyond Amazon's 30-day return period, and I'm not sure I want to spend even more money on this dud by seeing if it can be repaired.  So I guess the camera goes in the garbage. What a waste."
Kodak,Kodak EasyShare C182 Digital Camera Bundle(Purple),20111104,B00462RO2A,3,0,0,"on November 4, 2011",ANONYMOUS,Picture Quality Just Okay...,"Ive had this camera for a few years, and I do have to say its a pretty decent camera for the price. The features/settings are easy to use (if you can use the internet, you can use this camera).The image quality really varies, though. Sometimes I get amazing pictures, sometimes I get poor pictures, and most of the time I just get mediocore pictures. The 12.0 megapixel has little to do with picture quality- but more to do with picture size. The screen on the computer usually puts the pictures at 4000x3000. Thats fine, but sometimes the pictures come out a tad blurry or watery. Then again- this is a digital camera, and not a 35 mm. So I didnt expect perfectionIt does have a video camera as well- which is decent and has clarity. But the audio quality will be poor. (think bad mp3). So its a trade off.All in all this camera is good if you want to take some snap shots and get some good ones in. The majority of the pictures will be just okay to use, maybe for facebook photos to show your family and friends. It does have 'scene' options and flash as well. But it will not give you a great picture every use."

When I purchased this model it was a newer model than hers so I thought that it would be upgraded with speakers. I was wrong. It takes decent pictures and is easy to use but the other part totally makes it suck. Why should the camera be capable of recording videos if it's not capable of recording sound? Kodak dropped the ball on this one. With this being said I paid $85 on amazon.com, way too much if you ask me, and today Oct 8, 2011 I see it's selling for $125.00, I wouldn't dare pay that much. There are much better cameras at lower prices.EDITING REVIEW: Other customers have told me that the C182 does have sound, just not during playback on the camera. This to me still makes little sense, but I do like the camera and if I find this to be true...since I'm at work I can't check that--but I'm have the faith--then I apologize to Kodak for getting a little angry! Hope that makes everyone happy! I still wouldn't pay more than $60 for it if I had it to buy all over again.And I'm adding a star since my first review was 3 out of 5."

It drove me absolutely wild while I was trying to download pictures from the camera to computer for the first time.  It took MANY hours to get it working.  But I finally did.So for a summer 2011 trip, I bought two more Kodaks, one for me, one for my daughter.  Since I got the EasyShare software working, and when it works it really is pretty nice, I hoped to use the Easy Share software to make it easy to manage all three of our pictues together.  It hasn't worked out that way.I have spent MANY hours so far getting the computer and these two cameras to talk to each other.  They won't.  I have fought for hours with the software, trying to submit a trouble report on Kodak's web site that insists that I enter the camera model number but has no line entry for entering that model number so won't take my report, dealing with the email/chat support folks who don't read the emails and respond to questions I didn't ask, who barely understand English...  The software is completely rinky-dink, as if it were a favor that the neighbor's teenage kid did on a Sunday afternoon, not a professional, robust, smooth, 'it just works' commercial grade product.  Kodak's manual is absolutely pathetic, there are no meaningful instructions (the total extent of the instructions for transferring pictures is SIXTEEN WORDS -- no help at all if things don't work), and there are no trouble shooting instructions.  And I'm a pretty smart guy--a master's in computer engineering from one of the best engineering schools, gave invited lectures at MIT on computer science, etc -- if the software for this camera is giving me trouble, well, I don't know what Kodak expects everyone else to do.)I have just plain given up.  My Panasonic, which is a full-feature semi-professional model, FAR more complicated, is far simpler to use.  It just works -- plug it in, and everything just worked like it was supposed to.  I finally just took the memory card out of the Kodak, put it in the Panasonic, and transferred the pictures that way.I am as big a fan of 'buy American' as anyone, but this is the end of the line for Kodak and me.  Expect to see two Kodak cameras up for sale on eBay."

The first, which I'm still using, is a C340 Easy Share.  While the C182 has more features and Picture quality is great, Kodak Engineers must have been drinking heavily when they designed this one.  The left out important features.  For example the ability to automatically have a Date Stamp on Pictures.  My old camera once you set it to place a Date on each picture that's it.  You don't have to change it and every picture will have a date on it until you turn this feature off.  With the C182 you have to manually insert the date on each picture.  So if you take 500 pictures you have to do this 500 times....How stupid is this.My old C340 was able to retain the date on the camera even though it had no batteries for weeks and even months.  With this new C182 once the batteries are out for a short period of time you have to set the date and time again.  Foolish if you ask me.The pictures are great but so are other cameras.  Kodak needs to learn that when they build a new product it should have all the great features of their old products plus some new and improved onces.  If I had known that these features were left out I would not have gotten this camera."

I believe that after taxes, the camera cost about $64 because shipping was free.  However, when the camera finally arrived, I totalled up the extra monies I would have to pay and it came to over $100 which is why I returned the camera.  For example, the camera did NOT come with a memory card, and it only came with normal type batteries and I would have had to buy both a charger and chargeable batteries plus a memory card.  Actually, the only item I had expected to buy would have been a camera case which, of course, this item also did not come with.  Also, being brand new to using a digital camera, I was very unsatisfied that more detailed user instructions were only 'on line' and I felt I was learning a new software all over again.  The next time I decide to buy a digital camera, I will purchase one in a store where I can get assistance from a sales person and also make sure that the camera at least comes with a memory card and chargeable batteries as being part of the inital price."

If you use the Energizer ultimate lithium AA batteries in here it will take TONS of pictures before you have to change them.  Picture quality is ok, but seems to take a little longer to take a picture than my point and shoot canon cameras.

I didn't want to spend a lot of money and wanted good photo quality and a large video screen.  I needed an SD card to work with my laptop, and AA batteries so that I could use my NiMH rechargeables.  I also wanted a thicker body, to make the camera easier to handle while on the job.This camera had all of the features that I wanted, plus it has a great price at Amazon.  I believe that the 3' screen is an exclusive feature in this price range.I saw several reviews mention short battery life.  This didn't matter much to me, as I always carry spares.  But in the 3 weeks that I've had this camera, I've used it every day, taking over 300 photos without having to recharge or change the batteries yet.  So far, I can't find anything wrong with this one!I got a Lowepro Rezo 20 case for this camera and it's perfect for my needs.  The interior is exactly the right size for the camera, and the front pouch has room for 4 spare batteries and a spare SD card.  The belt loop is ideal for use in the field, and it comes with a shoulder strap (which I haven't used).Amazon sold me the camera, case, and 2GB SD card for less than $100, which included shipping.  You can't go wrong!"
Kodak,Kodak EasyShare C182 Digital Camera Bundle(Purple),20100501,B00462RO2A,3,20,21,"on May 1, 2010",ANONYMOUS,"Fine in ""P"" Mode","If this is your first digital camera, it would get five stars. It offers good cost-for-features value. If you are moving from a 5MP, or higher camera, it may not seem that good. The panorama stitch feature is fun to use and the shake reduction works well enough.I bought this to compare to my 5MP, Kodak Z730. The first pictures I took were in low light and were noticeably noisier than the Z730. Outdoor shots, in bright light, were not much different than the Z730.I now shoot most pictures in 'P' mode. Using the menu, I set the camera for ISO 100, Sharpness to 'Sharp' and Color Mode to 'High Color.' This gives better pictures. One reason the older camera is so good, it has the f/2.8-5.6, Schneider-Kreuznach, glass lens.The 3' LCD screen is nice, though difficult to see in bright sunlight, as most are. The buttons and menus are easy to use. If you are not used to Kodak cameras, the C182 is easy to learn. To get the most out of all of the features, download the extended user guide from kodak.comI use Sanyo Eneloop NiMH rechargeable batteries. After more than 100 pictures, the battery indicator shows about 50% left. I have 'played' with the settings quite a bit and I upload pictures using the USB cable. This requires the camera to be turned on. It would save energy to remove the SDHC card (8GB Toshiba) and connect it directly to the computer. If a friend asked me about buying a C182, I would say yes.Updated August 8,2010: This is not a low light camera. No matter what settings I use, there is a lot of 'noise' in pictures taken in low light. It is also difficult to get subjects in focus in low light. The exception is using the flash with subjects that are close to the camera. Switching to 'Blur Reduction' mode, puts the camera back to automatic for ISO, shutter speed, etc. Using a tripod would probably resolve these issues. 'P' mode is Program mode. All modes are accessed by the Mode dial on the top right of the camera. Information for modes and setting them is available in the extended user guide at [...]."

If you want a value camera this is it.

When I tried to install software to transfer to the internet it wouldn't work (line 10 error). So far am very dissatisfied with it. Andrew W. Ford Jr.

However, there's one MAJOR disappointments with this product which I found as soon as I opened the box, and before any photos were taken- This camera uses a MICRO SD card.  Dumb.  Virtually all computers- laptops and desktops- now come with a regular-size SD card reader.  So why would Kodak fool around with a micro-SD card which requires you to keep track of a small adapter to plug the micro-SD card into a regular SD card slot.  Again I say- dumb.On top of that, Kodak's a company that has been having deep financial problems for a long time because they got into digital photography far later than they should have.  Do you really want to buy a camera from a potentially vanishing company?  Why not from somebody like Panasonic, Canon, Nikon and others who appear to be in the game for the long haul."

I've been using the Easyshare Touch M5370 for about two weeks now, and I have taken some pretty amazing pictures.The different modes are really helpful when trying to capture pictures in low lighting or fast motion. If you buy this camera make sure to utilize the different modes (there are many) to take full advantage of what this camera can do. Also, you have the options to edit the photos right on the camera, which is pretty cool.Pros:<br />Great touch screen (better than I expected)<br />Good flash<br />Nice on camera editing capabilities<br />Option to tag photos on camera and sort by tags, date, ect.<br />Facial recognition for tagging photos. (it does actually work on many of my photos, surprisingly!)<br />Many modes for different lighting/scenarios<br />Decent low lighting photos (as long as you chose the appropriate mode - some other reviews say it just has an 'okay' low lighting photo, but I think it's pretty amazing as long as you are in the right mode and not just the standard 'program' mode)<br />The color of the blue model is stunning!<br />Comes to camera strap!Cons:<br />Was worried at first that the cameras appearance seemed a little cheap (however it has has been sturdy so far and was okay even after I dropped it the other day)<br />The touch screen layout was a tad confusing at first (different from anything I have used before - was able to figure it out though)Overall I really recommend this camera. It is a great buy for this price on Amazon!<br />I love it so far. I was skeptical at first because I looked at so many camera and been pouring through Amazon reviews to find the 'perfect camera' and it seemed like every camera I found had its flaws. But in the end after using this one I think its amazing and great for anyone that wants to take digital pictures and doesn't have around $400 to spend!"

I wind up so frustrated because I'm missing half of the show (I'm usually at a concert or something) because I'm messing w/the camera trying to get a clear shot.  It's awesome if you're at a small gathering taking pictures, but anything that's in motion - forget it.

The camera will work good about 5% of the time.  The other 95% of the time, it has one issue or another.  I have never dropped this camera and typically use it on default settings, so it has not seen any misuse on my part.<br />This camera will frequently take pictures that were tinted orange and have verticle or horizontal stripes through them.  There are times when these are the only pictures it will take.<br />It also suffers from lag and frequent freezing.  When I press the power button, it takes significantly longer to start up than it used to.  Then it prompts me to set the date and time, but if I do it, it will simply prompt me again next time, so I no longer bother with this step.<br />The most frustrating lag is the lag time while taking a photo. I can push the button to take a picture and my daughter can run laps around the living room before it will finally take the shot.  This is in the &#34;smart capture&#34; mode, the exposure has not been altered.  It's hard to capture a moving toddler as it is and is darn near impossible to do this when you never know how long the lag is going to be or when the picture will finally be taken.  It's even difficult to capture her when she is sleeping because if my hands move even the slightest when it is lagging, it makes the picture blurry. Sometimes this lag turns into it freezing completely and I have to remove the battery to reset it.  It also lags when viewing photos and freezes frequently.<br />This camera became practically useless in just a short period of time.  If I want to get a good picture, I literally have to take 70 shots before I get one that has my intended target in the shot and isn't orange and striped or blurry.  I bought a refurbished camera because I couldn't afford a new one and feel I pretty much wasted my money."

I am a point and shoot user.  I've never had a fancy camera.  In addition to this camera, I have a Canon Powershot.  I will say that I prefer the Canon.  The Kodak definitely has advantages - the touch screen is nice, the image for pictures is nice and large, it's easy to scroll through pictures and quick to download the pictures from the camera.  However, for me there are two big minuses.  First, it is VERY easy to delete all of the pictures from the camera.  My 19 month old got her hands on my camera and in less than a minute, all of my pictures were deleted.  That won't happen with the Canon (my version is the 1300 pixel, light blue - I got it in early 2010).  Second, the Kodak doesn't take great pictures.  The Canon pictures look better even though this Kodak has more pixels.  I find that the pictures often come out too blurry and dark.  I find that with the Canon most of my pictures are good. In fact, I've even had some DSLR snobs ask me what type of camera I used when I posted some newborn pictures I took on facebook.  The pictures come out nice and crisp. With the Kodak, not so.  I get a bunch of OK pictures, but nothing great.  Overall, this camera is nothing to write home about.  2 stars."

However, it's not all that easy, you have to install and configure the Kodak software and mark photos on the camera to be uploaded, etc. Since you have to hook up the camera to a computer to send them, it saves a fairly minimal amount of time. The photos are decent enough in good light conditions but personally I find the touch screen interface annoying and not not particularly easy to use. Reviewing images can be slow and the screen not sharp enough to really judge them well. If you are just a point-and-shoot consumer, you may not mind this but if you want to tweak your shooting at all, this is not the camera to get. I'm not really sure the 16MP is a plus, consumers think more megapixels, the better, but you aren't going to get much benefit from that, and the photos just will take up lots of additional room on your computer. The image quality is reasonably good for a camera in this price range, and the 5x zoom also better than the more typical 3x than many cameras this size have, but I personally find I often want even more reach (not counting digital zoom which pales in comparison to real optical zoom) and you will definitely find better image quality as well in slightly more expensive cameras. The images were still a bit soft and with a bit of purple fringing and low light definitely was sub-par. Again, if you don't care about this kind of stuff, and you want something in this price range, you may be okay with this camera, I personally look for something better. I also don't like the micro-SD card at all, most cameras this size use normal SC cards which are cheaper, far more ubiquitous, and many laptops, printers, etc. have readers built right in. These micro cards are really easy to lose, and you need a converter to read them in a normal SD slot. This alone is a big reason I would not recommend this camera real highly.If you are on a really tight budget and can't spend much on a camera, this might be one to consider. For its price, it's pretty decent. I just personally would look for a camera with a few more features and shooting options, that is going to do a better job in more situations."

The picture quality is amazing.  Does well in low light situations.  The only thing I would say negative is the amount of time it takes for the picture to disappear off of the screen before you are able take another picture.

My sanyo was just a 6 mega pixel and my pictures now compared from then are much better.It has a setting for taking pictures of moving children which really comes in handy for parents with active children. I have been taking pictures non stop of my children since i got it, the only downside is that it eats batteries, the Kodak batteries that came with it only lasted for 2 hours , i suggest investing rechargeable ones, the Duracell rechargeable batteries are great for this camera it has been 3 days since i recharged my batteries and they are no where near dying."

The ad showed a 'C913' but we were sold the 'CD93' instead, and as it turns out, they are the same camera.  The power button is tiny and difficult to push.  So when the camera would NOT power on after several tries, I decided it was because it was so difficult to actually depress the button.  But sometimes it does turn on easily.  Basically, the power button just plain doesn't work 9 times out of 10.  If I take the batteries out, jostle things around, replace the batteries, they try again, the power might come on.  But usually it just won't turn on.  Also, the 1GB card that came with it doesn't work.  I put the card in, and it said 'Card Unusable.'  What's the point of including a memory card that doesn't work with the camera?  And the camera won't let you do anything else (like choose to use internal memory) because it won't exit the 'Card unusable' screen.  This camera is trash.  I took it back to Staples and spent half an hour trying to get some reasonable help.  They finally agreed to replace it with a C913.  So far the power button on the C913 has worked MORE OFTEN, but still not all the time!  Will review that camera too...Oh, and both cameras are advertised as 9.2 MP online, on the box, and on the camera case.  But the camera only takes up to 9.0 MP resolution, as seen on the resolution selection menu and LCD screen photo information.  There's not a great difference, but it's still false advertising."

It has lot of options when it comes to taking pictures and also had lots of easier options for the people who are not that good at digital cameras. I also like the fact that you can crop rotate and enhance your pictures right on the camera instead of downloading them and doing them on another program.  I love the color. It also came with a battery charger and the batteries have lasted above expectations. Someday though I hope to use this camera for all of it abilites there is a lot of thigs you can do.

I believe this camera best suites someone who is looking for an upgrade from a lower megapixel to a higher megapixel camera and not vice versa [like me]. It does take great pictures, don't get me wrong, but once you've had a 10.3 MP and drop to a 9.2, you will be comparing images for a while. My camera also came with a mini charger and rechargable batteries [which does not work and makes me consider taking the camera back, considering reviews say it eats batteries] and a cute little drawstring bag that you have to shake a dozen times until the camera comes out. [Please note that the camera I'm reviewing does NOT come with the charger and drawstring bag] I've recorded one video and I cannot hear sound during playback and I am unable to make it play through my computer, so I do not know if it has sound at all.

I have had a few big problems with it though, one being every so often it will decide that my memory card needs formatting and won't turn on until I do it. It also tells me if I format it, it will delete everything off of it. Then I turn it on and off a couple times (usually 4-6) and it'll be fine again. I've missed a few really good shots at concerts or the zoo because it wouldn't turn on when I needed it to.<br />Also when I plug it into my computer, unless I go in and actually transfer the pictures one by one on my own, it will decide which ones it wants to transfer and which ones it does not and proceeds to delete the pictures that it doesn't want to transfer. This really sucks because I've lost a lot of really good pictures this way.All in all, for the money, it's a good little cheap camera, just not very convenient."

The 10.1MP always seems to be perfect for every setting I'm shooting in. The video does a great job in good lighting and the closer the better. I find myself pushing this camera to it's limits when recording video objects/people too far and the focus goes in and out pretty often - ruins the video in my case. I record my Daughter's dance performances and the blurry moments are just hard to experience when you'd like a clear picture throughout. But this inst a camcorder and I shouldn't expect so much. In normal recording conditions (light, closer objects/people) the camera is awesome. Taking pictures in low-light settings is also great - you good 4-5 feet form your focus and the picture quality is outstanding. I've compared this camera recently to a Fuji film s2850 and I'm now returning it since this Kodak won the testing in every way :)"

Our HR department needed something compact they could carry to functions and was SUPER easy to use.  Kodak has always been known for their user friendly interface and our HR department specially asked if we could get a Kodak for them, since they already new the interface.  I will give Kodak credit that the user interface is just as simple and streamlined as all their other cameras, but that really is the end of the positives on this camera.  Although we got this camera for a decent deal on Amazon, I still wouldn't buy it again.  Here's why.Pros:<br /> - Easy user interface<br /> - Compact<br /> - Lithium batteryCons:<br /> - Case and buttons are very cheaply made.  The shutter button feels like it is just a plastic button covered in a silver paint.  The buttons are 'wiggily' and don't have that firm, well built feeling.  I am always afraid the shutter button will get stuck in the body of the camera when you push it down.<br /> - AF focus noise: This has been a common compliant with this camera.  The camera tries to adjust the focus when you move the camera, to make sure the new subject is in focus.  Only while it focuses, it makes a really annoying buzzing sound.  There is a fix, you can turn off multiple AF and put it on single AF mode but that means you are having to disable a part of the camera's function to make it usable.  I have never seen this with any other camera before<br /> - Picture quality is not that great.  It is not terrible, but there are several cameras, including the Canon SD1300, in the same price point that take nicer pictures.I could go on about other things I don't like about it, but these are really the ones the average user will be affected by and ultimately disappointed by.  My best recommendation is to go to a store like Best Buy or Fry's Electronics and test the cameras out first before you buy them."

Pictures taken in bright sunlight were impossible to center - you just can't see the screen!  I used it all year long and 20 days after the warranty ran out, it refused to open and stay open.  We were told by Kodak Chat that, because it was still considered a new purchase, that the repair would be covered under the warranty and we sent it in.  Then, we received an email stating that this $100 camera would cost $73 to be fixed.  My husband called them and the end result was that they needed a receipt - which we obtained at Best Buy - they wouldn't honor the warranty and if we wanted it returned, they would charge us $35.  We told them they could keep it!They certainly missed the boat on good customer relations by being rigid with the warranty (20 days over?) and they have lost two customers plus any recommendations that we could pass on to others.

Kodak,Kodak Easyshare M340 Digital Camera (Red),20091230,B001OC7IUI,5,7,7,"on December 30, 2009",ANONYMOUS,I Love this Camera...,"OK, I've only had it for about a week, but so far it's been great.  I'm heading to France in a couple weeks and I wanted an affordable camera that takes great pics in the $100 price range. I researched cameras quite a bit and found this model to have the overall best user satisfaction ratings.  I will also write a follow-up review once I get back from my trip to report any possible problems, if any, I come across.I went to Target to find this model but they were all out and in desperation, I bought the pretty Olympus FE-4000 - one camera that I did not actually research.  Once I got home, I snapped a few pics with it and they were all blurry.  I read a few reviews and they were pretty awful so I exchanged the camera the very next morning and found that Target did get a few deliveries of the M340 so I snatched one up.The camera's great.  It's so easy to use right out of the box.  The LCD screen is big considering the size of the camera.  There's a button dedicated to flash settings so that you can turn it on and off on-the-fly.  Again, the camera is very user-friendly.  If you apply just enough pressure to the shutter switch, the camera automatically focuses and you can press it down fully to take a snapshot.  It's also pretty quick from the time you press the switch to the time it takes to snap a photo.  The battery-life is also very long.  I will address this in my follow-up as well.One thing I did notice was the constant motor noise when the camera is on.  It's a subtle noise, but it can get a bit annoying.  I noticed a couple people here have addressed this, but I would also like to clarify further.  If you turn AF (Auto Focus) to 'Single AF' in Video Mode, the noise will cease.  You have to do this in each setting you are able to on the small round click wheel in order to stop this in each mode.  I do like using Smart Capture mode and I realized that this noise cannot be stopped entirely in that mode.  Although switching the setting in Video Mode does minimize the noise in Auto Mode, it does not stop it entirely.  You can turn it off in Program Mode as well by setting Auto Focus to 'Single AF' in the settings.  The reason why this noise occurs is because the motor in the camera is constantly trying to focus as the camera moves or lighting changes.  If it is set to 'Constant AF,' it will repeatedly make this noise as the camera is always trying to focus.So, I love this camera so far.  It is small enough to fit in your pocket without any noticeable bulkiness.  The design is sleek and it's just a pretty little camera.  It's easy to use right out of the box and navigation in any menu is never tedious or hard to decipher.  There is also a 'i' button that allows you to display information about any menu setting highlighted just in case you are not sure what you're looking at.The one thing that would have been nice was an 'old-school' viewfinder since the only way you can view the pics you're taking is through the LCD screen.  This is just a minor gripe, but it can be a hassle if you're taking pics while outside and the sun is beaming causing a lot of glare on the screen making it hard to see what you're taking a picture of.  Other than that, this is an awesome camera!!!"

Had I come to Amazon.com sooner I would have saved myself a trip to BestBuy to return the one previous.

I am now aware as most of us are thanks to Marlene that this was a small problem fixable by simply going through the video options. I did try the settings but didn't realize that I needed to be in video for video settings :-/ it still has a click every now and again but it is nowhere near as much or annoying as it was before when the setting was on continuous....I'd prefer there be NO noise but hey for the great price he paid this camera is well worth it minus that one flaw.<br />The pictures so far have all come out perfect, not one bad photo yet.

I took a 4 hour trip to bear valley and while my friend was driving I was snapping like crazy out the window. At 80 mph I got crazy clear shots. Some of the best I have ever taken. For being so cheap $$ wise this camera packs a punch. The Image stabilization is great. Passing signs on the road I would time the shot and get clear details. I'm not here to write some lengthy review of the specs, but this camera has changed my life. I'm 22 and if I had never bought this camera and seen my potential I would have never gotten into Photography, astro-photography, webdesign etc. Bottom line is this picture is for taking pictures. It makes clicking noises which doesn't bother me. It is so cheap you don't have to worry about scratching it. It is so portable. It starts up quick which allows me to catch those once in a lifetime shots. Excellent detail without zoom. With zoom pictures can be blurry. Dont buy this camera for crazy crystal clear zoom shots. I have gotten great detail with the zoom but it may take a few shots. Battery is awesome. Menu is simple. Basic set of modes. Good sized screen. The key is having a large memory card. I have 8 gigabytes so thats around 4000 pictures. I literally point and click 20 pictures. Moving at 80mph 14 out of 20 will be crisp. On that bear valley trip I took 2000 pictures. Buy this camera if your thinking of starting photography but don't want to invest lots of money and find out its not for you. I think of this camera as a good old friend."

She was very respectful and helpful, and she solved the issue quickly.Additional CommentI've now had the camera for a few months.  I wasn't sure at first how I felt because there is definite noise above ISO 400 (200 works best).  However, a few things changed my mind.  I did a color test comparing it and a more expensive Canon I have to my high-quality dslr.  The Kodak was much closer in color to the dslr than the Canon.  The color in general was much brighter and more accurate.  I also ran the pictures through my photo editing software.  The pictures needed very little adjustment according to the histogram- only a little sharpening.Overall, this camera is definitely worth the small price."

Affordable cell phones cannot do the closeups, panoramas and other settings that this camera offers. She has a digital SLR. It is bulky and heavy, but does have a direct viewfinder. The M340 has only the LCD screen to view the subject. Sadly, it 'washes out' and is inadequate in bright daylight.Unfortunately, this M340 has a zoom lens problem like so many other compact digitals and it has been sent back for repair once under warranty. Now, four months later, the lens again zooms out instantly retracts and shuts down.I did all of the troubleshooting recommended, like compressed air cleaning and various resets, but no good.So I may send it back to United Camera ($64 for standard lens repair) and hope that it lasts this time as a backup.I have ordered her a Panasonic DMC-ZR3 replacement. It has a wide 25mm Leica lens and a better reliability rating"

The lens mechanism is extremely fragile and is likely to fail within the first year. Any small particles of dust, sand, fiber can prevent the lens from opening/closing and can ruin the auto focus permanently. This type of error is also NOT covered by the warranty and the cost to repair the camera will be close to the cost of the camera itself. The user interface is minimalistic with very few options regarding focus, lighting, etc. Due to lens problems, portability can be considered low. Best to steer clear of this particular product."

It's not the greatest for taking pics in dark settings, like weddings, candlelit rooms. Esp. if you don't have steady hands. Also, the motion pic. setting doesnt allow you to use ANY other feat., meaning you need to be in ideal lite, you cant turn off the flash or sound, and you still need to have steady hands. I've tried taking pics of animals doing cute stuff, and by the time the shutter clicks, the moments gone. Even with that, the biggest prob. i have is that i thought u could email from the camera to an e-address. NOPE. I still havent figured out how to email the pics. I just copy and paste. You also cant crop the pics on the camera. I went online after checking the manual to try to email the pics. but they dont just come out and tell u that u cant. They make u figure it out on u'r own. Also, when u try to do ANYTHING more than take a pic, like figure out what all u'r camera can do, the manual takes u thru the 1st few steps and then tells u to go online to do anything more. So this is a good camera if u just want to take pictures in good lighting, and print them out or keep them on your camera."

Its slim, light weight, and beats my 5mp crappy phone sensor. Very pocketable. I use it when i need better quality than my phone, but not the weight and size of my interchangeable lens system. Its 2013 so i tend to be biased compared to large sensor cameras, lack of 720/1080 video, and android cam apps. Every camera and phones that i had in the past produced very good quality VGA video. Not this cam. It has panorama, timer, burst mode, exposure adjustment, different scene modes, auto, typical or acceptable macro for cameras in this class. Despite image quality being better than my phone cam, the lens produces more distortion. What i like about it is it charges from any usb port, but needs a special proprietary usb cable. Beats carrying a separate charger. If i ever buy another compact i want it to have a standard micro usb connector for charging."

(Go to the Support tab at Kodak and put this article number in the search box: 48148.)I had some trouble getting my computer to recognize the camera, but this probably only happened because I used to have EasyShare installed. Even after uninstalling the software, it turned out that the driver for EasyShare was listed with other USB devices in Windows XP's Device Manager. I tried disabling it, but that didn't work. After uninstalling the driver completely, Windows was able to recognize the camera as a regular USB device.Don't try to install EasyShare and you'll probably be fine."

My previous camera (Olympus) was a 'plug & play' affair which acted pretty much like another hard drive on my computer with no additional software required.The USB cable connector was a very tight fit into the camera socket.  When removing the cable, I would have to wiggle and pull to disconnect the cable.  Maybe it just needed to be 'broken-in' but I'm certain that after a few connects and disconnects, it would just be 'broken.'I probably could have lived with any one of these quirks but the combination of all three, added up to a disappointing purchase.

The DX4530 updates the line with a larger, 5.0-megapixel CCD that captures  high-quality images with good detail. Although exposure control is fully automatic, the DX4530 performs surprisingly well in a variety of situations, and offers a few preset scene modes for shooting in low lighting or capturing action shots.  A range of manually-selectable longer exposure times extends the camera's capabilities  as well, without getting too complicated. If you're looking for a lot of pixels  combined with ease of use, all at an attractive price, the DX4530 would be a  good choice.'Also why it's great for novices to experienced amateurs:  'Although the DX4530 offers only fully automatic white balance, Kodak's Color Science technology does a superb job of producing  accurate color under almost any light source.''The DX4530 squeezes into larger shirt and coat pockets, and comes with a wrist strap for carrying. The camera's compact design includes a retractable lens, protected by a removable plastic lens cap (a tiny strap tethers it to the camera body so you won't lose it). Though exposure features and overall setup are similar to previous EasyShare models (most notably the DX4330 model), the DX4530 boasts a larger, 5.0-megapixel CCD for capturing high resolution, print quality images, as well as smaller image sizes better suited for distributing via email.'Another review at Steve's Digicams concludes: 'The DX4530 is an entry-level yet high resolution camera with a quality 3x optical zoom lens. This is a perfect camera for anyone that wants to easily capture sharp and well saturated pictures, indoors or out, with little or no prior experience. And with an average street price of $350 or less you won't need a bank loan to purchase one.' It shoots 'gorgeous prints' and 'The bottom line on the DX4530 is that it captures very good images in a variety of sizes suitable for email use to wall-size enlargements. It's easy to use and is priced within the budgets of many consumers that previously would have only been able to buy a lower resolution camera.A world class lens and powerful 5.0 MP combine to give you huge, stunning prints up to 20'x30' (50x75cm)KODAK RETINAR Aspheric All-Glass Lens with 3X optical zoomBright indoor/outdoor displayProgrammed scene modes and creative settingsSharing is one-touch simpleVideo and audio captureAnd as Kodak shows on their home page: 'J.D. Power and Associates ranked KODAK EASYSHARE Digital Cameras 'Highest in Customer Satisfaction in the $200-$399 and the $400-$599 price ranges.'This is one of those cameras that will provide great shots and last for many years to come at a great price.  The kodak site (and many others) retail it for $299, camera only.  Because it's not the newest of the brand new, you can get a great deal on it in comparison to those that are the cutting edge, just-released models. Other 5MP cameras in this price range are nowhere near the quality, design or output.The DX4530  makes for a great holiday gift that's not so hard on the wallet.  This is one sweet camera especially for those who don't want to have to spend a lot of time reading tiny print, learning a million geek-tweaks -- it's easy to take it out and start shooting.  Great for grandparents, newbies and bargain-hunters."

For the most part the camera is simple to use and the 5.0 megapixels is good enough for anyone who just wants to take quality pictures. The downside that I had with the camera, is when I was on 'Live View'. Being on Live View allowed me to view my subject through the LCD screen instead of using the viewfinder, and the Live View setting drained a lot of battery power, especially when I was in Macro and Video mode. I highly recommend rechargeable batteries. Other than that, the camera is perfect for the beginners."

Kodak,Kodak EasyShare DX4530 5MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,20040101,B0000APONO,4,1,2,"on January 1, 2004",ANONYMOUS,New to Digital,"First off, I am an amateur photographer and use a Nikon SLR for most of my 'serious' pictures. But I really wanted a camera for every day use. One that fits in my purse, but wasn't so small that my husband couldn't use it too. After a lot of research, I decided digital was the way to go and bought the Kodak DX4530.I love the camera. My husband actually enjoys taking pictures now too. The picture quality is great. The night setting is awesome and has just the right amount of flash to take clear pictures in low light. The LCD screen is crystal clear in good lighting, but harder to see in low light, only when framing your picture though. Once the shot is taken, it appears in true form on the LCD. It is also fast - so you don't miss those important shots and I haven't had any problems with blurry shots.The only things I don't like about the camera are probably the features Kodak scrimped on in order to offer the DX4530 at such a great price. 1) The lens cap falls off on it's own in the camera bag. 2) The lens is a Kodak, not the higher quality lens protected by a shutter found on some of KPdak's pricier cameras. 3) This is no fault of Kodak, but with 5 MP, the pictures take up a lot of memory, on the camera and on the memory card, so you definitely want to buy a memory card, maybe a few. But I am sure those are the sacrifices made to get a 5 MP at or below $300."

Kodak,Kodak EasyShare DX4530 5MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,20031228,B0000APONO,5,8,8,"on December 28, 2003",ANONYMOUS,Best buy for money,"I absolutely love this camera!  A lot of people have been complaining about the lack of 'features' and that a serious photographer wouldn't like this camera, well, I disagree.  I am a professional photographer and use mostly Nikon SLR technology, but sometimes carrying around a bulky camera just isn't logical.  If you are looking for a camera that gives great results in a small package, this is for you.  At 5 MP you get the quality that a good photo needs, and the price is more than affordable.  Also, this camera is faster than a lot of others on the market right now.  The click-to-capture delay is minimal, and the size of the camera is great.  A+++"
Kodak,Kodak EasyShare DX4530 5MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,20031228,B0000APONO,4,6,6,"on December 28, 2003",ANONYMOUS,Very easy to use,"I got this camera about a month ago; I am a big photography nut and am very literate with both SLR cameras and digital.  My father bought this camera for me, and although it wasn't as 'high tech' as the cameras I was originally comparing, I must say that I am fairly pleased with the Kodak.The internal memory is nice because you don't have to buy a memory card unless you take several dozen pictures at a time.  It will hold about 24 pictures taken in the highest quality setting.The controls are simple and easy to understand; many digital cameras overwhelm the user with difficult, confusing, and seemingly endless menus.  Unless you like being able to control the shutter speed, aperature, and other manual settings, you'll enjoy how simple the Kodak makes digital photography.  A big plus is that the camera includes a brief explanation for menu items so that the user isn't confused about what abbreviations stand for.Some people have mentioned the blurring that takes place; blurring takes place with most cameras because the shutter speed is generally slower with digital cameras.  And the shutter delay is VERY good with this camera; several digital cameras that I have tested have had horrible shutter lag.  The Kodak's delay is minimal.The dock is nice for convenient recharging; once you're done taking pictures, just put it on the dock.  It's also nice for transferring pictures.  Put the camera on the dock, push the 'Kodak' button, and your preferred program automatically opens for downloading.  One downfall I've found is that the software is not compatible with Mac OS X, which I have, so I've had to use iPhoto for downloading pictures.  (Which is fine, since that's where I keep pictures anyway.)  (UPDATE:  The software is now compatible with Mac OSX.)In short:  pros of this camera: ease of use, simple menus, convenient recharging, internal memory (no need for memory card).  Cons:  short battery life when using LCD screen for picture taking; lens cap has a tendency to come off when bumped slightly (bad if you're carrying it in a bag)."
