I wore out my WB250 over 2 years of constant use, however I do not think this WB1100 is going to outlast the WB250.  I started getting flash and white out on the display screen, the WB1100 is starting to show a similar screen white out and I've only had it for 2 months.  I have a feeling that the unit which was reconditioned and certified by olympus was not fully certified.<br />  I have not notified the company that sold the unit, I don't think it is their fault however I wish I had spent $30.00 more to get the WB350 OR WB360 model, My wife has the WB350 and it is great.  I wanted the long some on the WB1100."

It takes good, clear pictures both at night and in the daytime. It really helps if you know what modes to select based on your environment and if you know about white balance, aperture etc. However, the auto mode works fairly well if you don't know about all of that. The best feature of this camera in my opinion is the lens. The zoom is great. Usually when you take zoomed in pictures, they tend to be of low quality, highlt pixelated and distorted but this rarely happens with this camera. It is good for wildlife photography, especially if you are photographing a particularly fidgety subject as it has a sport settung which is good for capturing fast moving things. Like I said, this is a good starter camera and great for practical learning."

She's always wanted a good DSLR camera, and this one didn't disappoint. It takes great photos with plenty of natural light displayed in the photos. The processing is spot on, both mechanical and digital. She hasn't really used it during the evening, but she has used her flash and it's fantastic. A little bright at times but it's a flash, so what are ya gonna do?<br /><br />The only problem with this camera is the battery. Each time the camera's done charging the camera won't turn on. I have to take out the battery and reinsert it so the camera would at least power on. It's done this since first boot. The battery life isn't that good either. It says that you can take like 400 photos before the camera turns off. She's experienced like 150 to 200 photos before it turns off. There was also no setup process. I don't know if that's an issue or not, but my mom thought there was something wrong with it when she noticed.<br /><br />But with all that aside, it's a good camera if you're just starting out in the DSLR game. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a decent camera that's not too expensive but still takes great photos."

Let me tell you why.,"I have dealt with many cameras during my lifetime. Either doing professional photos or fun personal pictures, I know what I'm dealing with. With the Samsung NX3000, since I been reading about the NX2000, I knew it was going to be a good camera. It takes amazing quality pictures. With the option of 20.3 MP, the images will have a lot of color and detail to them. It comes with many options, including with the improved smart options that allows the camera to take pictures for different scenes. For example, there is one smart mode for fireworks that allows pictures about fireworks to look amazing. The camera is easy to learn and honestly I recommend it a lot to people who does not want to spend a lot for a DSLR camera or get a no good cheap camera. This camera specs are like mid entry when compared to DSLR cameras. So you knowing your getting something that take pictures close to high end DSLR cameras. I do really recommend this camera. It is honestly a good deal. Also you get a copy of the latest Adobe Lightroom, which is a big plus. So anyone in the business of getting a smart camera, I would recommend this to you and to anyone else."

Every electronic has room for improvement, but this is my 8th digital camera in a long line of point-and-shoots, super-zooms and dSLR's, and it is the best I've ever had or used by leaps and bounds. It takes photos just as well as my dSLR with basic lenses but without all the bulk and hassle. I get people constantly asking me about this camera or commenting on my photos asking what I used. I've convinced 3 other people to purchase it and they all fell in immediate love with it. It is just so intuitive, quick to use, and the wifi uploading means I never have photos stay on my camera forever, never to see the light of day. It is probably one of my favorite electronics I've ever owned.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: Firstly I wanted to state that if you're considering buying this camera, add it to your cart and get the Amazon updates about price changes to items you've placed in your cart. Reason being, I just bought this brand new on Thursday or Friday (it is now Monday) and the price went up $100. While I was making my purchase decision I noticed this happened frequently.<br /><br />In terms of the 16-50mm OIS or the 20-50mm, get the 16-50. I will add a photo of each lens on the camera side-by-side. I initially received the wrong lens on the camera via a Warehouse Deal and had to purchase another and return it, so I had two cameras, one with a 16-50mm and one with a 20-50mm at the same time for a day. Anyway, the 16-50mm is silent when zooming and the 20-50 is far from silent. the 16-50mm is also almost an inch shorter.<br /><br />Why I chose NX3000 over NXMini:<br />- touch screen wasn't necessary for me<br />- I'd like to use my Canon lenses and the adapter to do so with the Mini is over $100, with the 3000 it is around $20. This was the main reasoning for me.<br />- Some reviews said the Mini had better battery life but come to find out, same battery<br />- It isn't THAT much smaller.<br /><br />Why I chose NX3000 vs NX300:<br />- 300's screen doesn't flip all the way up for &#34;selfies&#34; or vlogging if you do that.  The NX500 has both a touch screen like the Mini and a full flip out like the 3000, but is crazy expensive.<br /><br />Why I chose NX3000 over Sony a5000:<br />- Better battery life<br />- more intuitive<br />- cheaper<br />- felt bulkier<br />- preferred NX3000 quality in comparison photos and sample photos<br /><br />Pro's:<br />- Small, though slightly larger than point and shoots<br />- I honestly use my dSLR less and less<br />- flipping up the screen automatically turns on camera and a mode that smooths skin. Pretty amazing.<br />- You press the Mobile button, select &#34;select photos from camera&#34; it creates a wifi that I select on my phone, once connected (takes seconds) I open the Samsung app on my phone and send the photos I want on over. I can very quickly post photos from the camera to Instagram which is awesome.<br />- Very intuitve. Easiest to use camera I've ever had.<br />- Editing modes built right into the camera are as good as any photo editing app I have.<br />- Auto mode actually selects from various built in modes for you, and the built in modes are pretty awesome and specific.<br />- photo quality is so awesome, I was so surprised.<br />- Focuses quickly<br /><br />Con's<br />- I wish there were more WIFI options like uploading straight to iCloud or Picasa. With the touchscreen versions there is an option or direct to Facebook, I haven't found that's true on the NX3000 so far but I don't think so.<br />- I wish there was a little dongle for the lens cap, it is so tiny! I bought one from eBay by searching &#34;lens cap holder&#34;<br />- MicroSD. Yikes, I'm going to lose so many of these lol. Make sure to get a high speed one (10x I think is the fastest?)<br />- I wish the screen also turned all the way around like my Canon T3i, so that it remains protected. I bought screen covers and a case but still."

The body is sturdy plastic which makes gives you a lighter weight in exchange somewhat higher quality feel of a metal body. For on the go, I think this is camera is durable enough to withstand all but the worst abuse while not weighing you down and I like the vintage look of the body style.<br /><br />While I have and use a DSLR for dedicated photo shoots, I have come to like the more casual ease of use, compact size, and smaller lenses that a mirrorless cameras can use by putting the lens much closer to the sensor and remove the complex mirror that supports the for through the lens viewfinder. If you are thinking about a camera for travel, family events, or any other activity that you don't want to be a dedicated photojournalist and still participate in the activity I highly recommend you go this route.<br /><br />The NX3000 captures images on a 20.3 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor, no viewfinder is included, shots are taken using the 3-inch flip-up (not down) LCD screen. This flip up design is ideal for taking shots from a lower vantage point, keeping the camera in your lap while watching an event, or for selfies with wink-shot mode. The ISO range of 100-25,600 works great for indoor events that often have poor lighting with low noise up to fairly high ISO settings.  With the ability to record 1080p HD movies you can quickly capture all your memories with great detail. The built-in Wi-Fi and Near Field Communication (NFC) connectivity makes uploading or sharing photos quick and easy and you can use the Samsung app for remote control with live preview.<br /><br />I found the  5fps continuous shooting and 1/4000th second top shutter speed made it easy to capture some of the best action shots I have taken with any camera and the Sweep Panoramas is included to build a panorama shot in camera for those shots that just don't fit in a single shot. This camera kit includes a 16-50mm f3.5-5.6 lens with Optical Image Stabilization which greatly improves clarity when you don't have or can't use a tripod. And the included Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5 is a great value for tweaking photos once you get them on your computer (Mac or PC).<br /><br />The lens includes Samsung's standard i-Function button. When using the iFunction mode you can press an easy to access button on the lens barrel which allows you to modify a sub-set of key settings by rotating the focus ring. As you press through the options you can adjust shutter speed and/or aperture, ISO, exposure compensation, and white balance.<br /><br />The battery is huge, is only charged in the camera via microUSB, and the memory card is MicroSD / MicroSDHC / MicroSDXC.  I am personally not a big fan of these as they are too easy to lose if dropped. Fortunately storage size has gone up and price has gone down, so you may not ever need to remove it.<br /><br />I generally shot in program mode so I can find a set of setting that work for the environment I am in and be assured that most every shot works. However I was very impressed with the Smart Auto system and the rest of the family can easily use the camera just point and click with great results.<br /><br />If you like you can use all kinds of in camera modes to modify the image, I found these fun to play with but generally don't use them on a regular basis. However I have used some of the post shot editing for redeye fix, backlight adjustment, changing the photo style, resizing, rotating, face retouch and using a couple of the smart filters."
Samsung,Samsung NX3000 Wireless Smart 20.3MP Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OIS Power Zoom Lens and Flash (Black),20140830,B00K88XMI6,3,17,35,"on August 30, 2014",ANONYMOUS,micro SD card NOT included--and watch out for unresponsive shutter,"Well, I have to thank Amazon for allowing me to review this. Undoubtedly you will read reviews from professional and &#34;high-amateurs&#34; of this camera. Let me give you the perspective of someone who has been known to take some great shots (and no small amount of bad ones). The short version is this: If you are going to spend $500+ on a camera, get a better one. I should add some kind of disclaimer that I normally like Samsung products (especially my Galaxy), but this camera feels like an economy version of a great camera. Imagine that &#34;first class tickets&#34; were the standard, and some airline exec threw in a few junky seats on the back of the plane, and called them &#34;economy.&#34; That is what we have here.<br /><br />The plastic feel of the camera is just wrong. It is brown, and the side panel door that protects(?) the HDMI and micro-USB (sorry Mac users - &#34;none for you!&#34;) is really flimsy. I think the construction of this camera is probably than it feels and looks, but I am reticent to break it apart and examine the inner workings. Also, the power button is &#34;right next to&#34; the shutter button. It is too easy to accidentally turn the camera off instead of getting the right shot.<br /><br />Okay, so it has all of the normal bells and whistles: f-stop, aperture, Wi-Fi, NFC, and shutter speed--pretty much everything you would think that makes this a great camera. Here's where it fails, and why I am only giving it 3 stars. My Samsung Galaxy (3!) and my iPhone 5s take better pictures! Do you get a larger picture with this? Yes. But by the time the auto-focus has resolved itself the cat has moved (1-2 second delay often), or the camera refuses to take a shot until the light sensor adjusts (wave the camera around and it fixes itself) and then you take the same shot and it pulls in tons of light. It works, it is just high maintenance. Also, the screen flips up (&#34;OMG!! for selfies!&#34;) over the top of the camera. This may not be a truly bad feature, but it smacks the screen glass up against the flash. Also, the zoom is pathetic. For the money you spend on a camera that does NOT come attached to a phone I simply expected more. From a company named Samsung, I certainly did not expect such a cheap feeling camera.<br /><br />On the up-side, I did like the quick release lens, and the video and burst modes. The same problem applies, where the shutter button is often unresponsive, causing you to miss your shot, or the auto-focus refuses to work at all, and you get a blurry shot, or takes so long that you miss the shot. This might be nice for close-up still life, but it is no action camera, and unless you want to spend money on more lenses, you are extremely limited by what they provide. A serious disappointment for the price.<br /><br />Also, don't expect an instruction manual. Batteries? Yes: instructions on how to use it? Of course not! There is the standard quick-start guide (fold-out brochure) that expects that you know all about photography (in which case you bought a better camera, whether less or more expensive). Also, it won't truly function without a micro SD. Not at all, really. I am being too generous here. Unless you happen to have a 32 meg or higher micro SD card, you will be disappointed on Christmas when you open your new camera and try to shoot pictures with it.<br /><br />For all of the bells and whistles built into this camera (and there are many), they could have made a truly great camera by not being so sting on the quality of materials, and a standard micro SD card, which would have cost Samsung pennies to make--and finally a much better lens. You really are much better just holding out for an Olympus E-P5 16.1, or opting for the much less expensive Olympus PEN E-P3. After all, this is an investment you will live with for years. Get something you won't regret later. Sorry Samsung--to everyone else: I hope this helped."

The biggest issue is that since this is a 20MP camera the resolution of the images as well as the video clips take up a lot of room but Amazon's complete video limit is only 100MB. So, I will have to degrade the high resolution clips and edit the length in order to accommodate the limits. The full, unedited version will be posted on YouTube.<br /><br />*** Features/ Samsung's ecosystem integration ***<br /><br />This camera, like almost all of Samsung's offerings for the past 2 years is feature-rich.<br /><br />I have both the Galaxy Note 4, the Galaxy Note 10.1, and 12.2 and like these devices, you have so many app's and functions built in that it's almost impossible to think of something you'd be in need of.<br /><br />You can connect to--in my case the phone and the tablets from this camera just by pushing the 'Mobile' Button. And, transferring files by using the 'NFC.'<br /><br />This looks like a traditional film camera but this is completely digital even down to the micro sd card slot and the micro usb charge port.<br /><br />*** Features ***<br /><br />This, for the money, maybe overkill if you want just a good camera with decent spec's without breaking the bank. I have my very trusty Canon Powershot A590 (which I still love) but use primarily for taking reference photos or the rare video shoot if I don't have anything else handy. And, I have an old Flip Mino HD, which I use for these video reviews because the 720 images I get from it is very good although it seems to be nearing the end of its life cycle. The Samsung seems to bridge the best of the Canon and the Flip. But, if you have a good phablet phone, like a Note 3 or the HTC One 8--you'll most likely not reach for this NX 3000 unless you have an intentional need for better pictures and video.<br /><br />The set features:<br /><br />* Camera body<br />* Internal rechargeable battery<br />* 16-50mm lens (digital lens)<br />* Quick Start & Quick Reference Guide<br />* Adapter cable<br />* Camera strap<br />* Flash<br /><br />(The camera set is missing a case which I think should have been included considering the price.)<br /><br />* A disk of Adobe Lightroom<br /><br />The camera's internal features:<br /><br />* HDMI port (left side)<br />* USB (micro) usb port (left side)<br />* Battery compartment & SD card compartment (bottom)<br />* tripod mount (bottom)<br />* recording indicator lights (top)<br />* Mobile button (top)<br />* Power button (top)<br />* Shutter button (top)<br />* Hot Shoe (top)<br />* Mode Dial (top)<br />* Microphone<br />* Video Record button (back)<br />* Fn button - 'Smart Panel' access key (back)<br />* Menu/ Shooting Modes dial (back)<br />* Flip Up Display (back)<br /><br />The camera is really lightweight considering what it does. The motor is extremely fast.<br /><br />This camera will most likely appeal to professional photographers as well.<br /><br />This camera also has standard features such as:<br /><br />* Image Stabilization<br />* ISO & White Balance settings and 'Metering'<br />* Minimum shutter speed in addition to photo and video editing features like Photo size, Photo Quality, Picture Wizard (filter effects), Smart Filter, Face Detection Framing Mode<br /><br />I just mentioned that the camera's motor is very fast and relatively silent. You also have a choice of shooting in the Continuous, Burst, Timer or Bracket shooting modes.<br /><br />** There's also a 'Dynamic Range' feature where the camera automatically adjusts details hidden in shadows.<br /><br />For video, you have the ability to:<br />* Select video resolution<br />* Movie quality<br />* Playback speed of the movie clip<br />* Add a fade effect (fade in or fade out) to a clip<br />* Adjust or edit the video sound.<br /><br />*** Really cool features ***<br /><br />If that wasn't enough, you can send your files via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth (NFC) to other Samsung or Android devices that have that option built into their OS. But, when connected to the Wi-Fi, you can also send your files to a cloud-based service like Dropbox or Box or even Google Drive. (I think Samsung and Google still are offering a 1-time storage gift of 1 Terrabyte of storage if you buy a Samsung product this year. But, it's only good for just one Samsung product.)<br /><br />There is a lot to this camera and even with 45 minutes of unedited video to process, there's still features that I need to find a purpose for. But, that's the fun part about it.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the camera set should have come with some kind of protective case, but it didn't. I'd also would have liked if Samsung had provide some kind of screen protector for the Pop Up display--because of the potential damage to that exposed glass.<br /><br />All in all, this camera is still a winner."

It takes surprisingly good high-quality pictures and video. It also has a lot of neat things that you can do (like slow down the time so you can get a perfect shot of really fast things- like a humming bird's wings flapping). This camera has a lot of good apps to go along with it to help add special effects to pictures and video; and there are plenty of free apps that you can download from the Play Store. This camera has the Android aspect of it too so it has a lot of the other neat things that come with phones - like notes, weather, google, and a billion other things. On on top of it all, the camera looks so very stylish and neat. Every time I draw it out to take a picture, people look at it with an &#34;I want one&#34; expression (lol) and they're fascinated by the touch-screen button-less appearance and the incredible pictures that come as a result.<br /><br />Love this product a lot and am very satisfied. Fast shipping. Literally like new quality. Functions perfectly. Nicely packaged.<br /><br />Recommendation: Although this camera does come with 8GB of internal storage, you definitely will want to buy a MicroSD card for additional storage. A big chunk of that 8GB is in storage for the camera itself (like hardware or something) and then apps and whatnot can take some too. I don't remember how much GB was left over for the pictures itself (and I'm too lazy to actually look) but I believe it was around 3.5GB, which isn't really enough if you want to conveniently store hundreds of videos and pictures. I used up all this storage after I had taken only about 350 pictures and a few videos shots. Therefore, if you buy this, you will definitely also want to get a MicroSD card - I would recommend a 64 GB Samsung EVO MicroSD card (I got mine for around $35 bucks discounted here on Amazon) but 32 or 16 GB of the same type would work too.<br /><br />(And just a side note: when I was researching a good MicroSD card, be careful of scam products. Some products advertsided 256 GB for like $10- those are scams. The highest a microsd card can hold at this point in time is 128GB (unless you spend several hundred dollars) and those 128GB will usually sell for close to or over $100. The ones that claim 256GB for really cheap prices are actually normal microsd cards that have been hacked to give the appearance that they hold more GB than they really do- they still work but once you reach the &#34;real&#34; limit, your data starts to disappear because you run out of storage. So you might think you have 256GB but in reality you only have a fake hacked 16GB card. So yes- go with trusted brands from trusted sellers and be skeptical of prices that are ridiculously low or microSD cards that offer more than 128GB. )"
