My first observation was how slow it was to take a picture after pressing the button.  I kept missing the shot I wanted because it took nearly a second to actually snap the picture after pressing the button.  Even after the half press to get the focus first, the full press took a long time to actually snap the shot.  Not only does this cause a frequent loss of the picture you want, but also leads to a lot of blurry photos because it's hard to hold perfectly still while waiting for the picture to snap a full second after pressing the button.<br />Later in the day, I used the camera on a tripod to take the traditional full family picture I always take at holidays.  The room was fairly well lit but not bright, and the camera was about 10 feet from the front row of people.  I used the timer and auto flash, which did go off.  Later when I downloaded the picture it was very grainy and orange as if the flash didn't quite reach the target.  My old powershot SD500 always got this shot perfect, but I dropped it around thanksgiving, and even though it still works perfectly, the case is bent and seams are a bit wider than they were before.  That's why I got a new one for Christmas.<br />In the end I returned the camera, and have another cannon on the way.  Cannon makes great cameras, but this one fell short of my expectations.  It seems like as these cameras become more feature laden, the shutter lag increases."

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.<br /><br />The ELPH130 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 16 resolution (megapixels), and a x8 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CCD-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.<br /><br />It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 6400, up from 1600 for the ELPH 115. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 461,000 resolution, up from 230,000 for the ELPH 115. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The burst rate is a reasonable 2.9 frames persecond- great for quick shots. The weight of the camera is a convenient 145 grams.<br /><br />Overall, nice, fun camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search. That will also tell you more about what you want."

To post directly to social media is something I do from my phone, not the camera.  Instead of wifi, I'd have liked more if there was a GPS option to geo-tag photos, that'd use constantly ...<br /><br />Final thoughs: this is an excellent compact camera, and so small I am prone to have it always on me; a great companion to the DSLR, but also would not look bad as your main camera if you're not too demanding."

I have spent the last two days trying to research fixes for these issues and am finding there are no fixes that work.

Recently, Amazon had lowered the price of the Elph 130 below that of any other seller, making it an unbeatable value for Prime subscribers ($93 for the red model).  What you'll get is a pocket rocket with 8X zoom (Canon's most powerful Elph is 12X) plus Wireless Connectivity.  The caveats, or possible 'downsides,' of the 130: the wide angle lens is an 'acceptable' 28mm (not 24mm); the DigiProcessor is the previous edition (4th) rather than the current Digic 5; the maximum aperture is f/3.2, which again is 'acceptable'; the camera does not bear the HS suffix (Canon's guarantee of rock-steady low-light shooting).  With these considerations in mind, the extra $30 for an Elph 330 strikes me as irresistible.]<br /><br />Amazon point and shoot shoppers are pretty savvy, as shown by the current listing of most popular models on Amazon.  Of all Canon Elves, the Elph 110 continues to hold a price that's close to retail ($200), thanks to consumer interest and 'Consumer Reports' ratings, but it's far from a 'value play.'  All of the cameras in the title are going for close to, and even under, $100, making each an attractive candidate for anyone looking for a subcompact camera that stands to shoot pictures with better resolution and sharper detail than a smartphone camera.<br /><br />The choice could easily come down to appearance --for example, a preference for the sharp edges and classic boxy look of the compact but highly competent 500 series over the somewhat 'softer'-looking 130.  But from the low-priced Elph 115 to the Elph 520, the dimensions, features, and actual results will be remarkably similar, with any particular Elph capable of producing the best pictures in the hands of a skilled and experienced photographer.<br /><br />The features that should be of least interest to the shopper are: 1. megapixels (10 is often as good if not better than 20); 2. movie pixels (720 will be as 'high def' to viewers'  eyes as 1080p); 3. size of screen (2.5' is as useful as 3' or larger, and any size can be worthless under a bright overhead sun); 4. the power of the zoom lens (telephoto lenses should not be a priority for the buyer of a subcompact camera--a lens of greater than 5:1 power may be an indication that the buyer should be looking at a larger camera, such as the Canon Powershot 260-280 line).<br /><br />The features that matter most to experienced photographers are: 1. focal length, especially where the wide angle lens is concerned (28mm is good, but 24mm is better, ensuring better focusing because of greater depth of field as well as the possibility of capturing a large cathedral without backing away by an extra block or two); 2. aperture--for low and and indoor available light shooting, a lens that opens up to f2.8 is better than one opening to f3.2. just as a lens that opens to f2.0 (as on my Canon Elph SD4000) will produce measurably better low-light results than an f2.8 lens; 3. 'Burst Mode,' which is especially useful (if not essential) for capturing images of pets and active children at just the 'right instant'; 4. face detection and automatic shutter (when I tell my grandkids to hold still for a picture, I'm usually ignored; when, on the other hand, I tell them that the camera will 'magically' take their picture if they look at it and smile, I or, rather, the camera suddenly has an attentive audience.  5.  Wi-fi, for those photographers who have been spoiled by their smartphones and wish to maintain 'social connectivity' while having access to a 'Cloud' where their pictures will be instantly stored and backed up.<br /><br />For most viewers, the Elph 130 comes closest to offering the most features for the least money--a camera that, in 2009, would have cost 2-3 times its present price.  HOWEVER, it doesn't have burst mode and, perhaps more importantly, the wide-angle lens is 28mm rather than 24mm. The Elph 330, therefore, deserves careful consideration for anyone who plans, for example, to shoot pets and appreciates the advantages of a wide-angle over a big zoom lens.  The Elph 520 looks highly attractive--on paper. But despite its ultra compactness and power, the reviews by users have not inspired confidence in the camera.  It's going for close to a hundred, so it may be worth a gamble if you can buy it from Amazon Prime and try it for 30 days (the new Digi 5 processor has not been getting high marks and may require some improvements.  In fact, Canon's newest Elph, the 340 (yet to be released), returns to the proven Digi-4 processor. Personally, I found that Canon's discontinued Elph 300 came closest to satisfying my wish list.  By looking at 'Like New' models offered by sellers through Prime (for easy returns), I found my Elph at my price point.  Yet I continue to hang on to my 'old' SD780 for those bright, sunny days since it was Canon's very last Elph with a viewfinder.<br /><br />Finally, you'll need an SD card.  If you plan to take movies, better make it 16GB.  And while you're at it, don't forget to pick up an extra Canon battery (the Canon SX160 may have been the last Canon to take regular alkaline batteries, and some Panasonics still make it easy by requiring a simple plug-in of the camera into any available AC outlet).  If you plan to get a case, be sure to check out the custom-fitted leather ones made by Canon, as some are currently being offered at a steep discount."

Portable, inexpensive, yet with a high optical zoom and good image stability.  There are undoubtedly other models with better features that take higher quality pictures, including Canon's own SX50, but none for under $200 that I could find.  Checking on reviews at various sites also led me to believe the SX500 IS was at least comparable, and usually better than the other 30x 'ultra' zoom cameras.<br /><br />After playing around with it a few days, mostly on the Auto setting, I'm very happy with the optical zoom and the image stability you get at 30x, better than I got with the Lumix at 10x.  Macro shots at an inch or less look great, at least in good light.  Low light shots get very grainy as the ISO kicks up to 800 very quickly so I'll be playing with the manual settings more there.  Tons of those settings that I'll have to really study--as another review pointed out, this isn't a beginner's camera, but then I didn't want one and am willing to dive into the details a bit.<br /><br />Possible cons: movies are 'only' at 720, but look plenty good (for 1080, maybe consider the SX50?).  The aperture speed was rated low for this camera at just under 1 sec.  Haven't taken any high speed shots yet, say a bird in flight, so I can't comment on it yet.  The battery life is also supposedly short, but I always get a spare (2 for $15).  My maybe biggest gripe is the awkward shape, which is to say the lens is very long, so the camera is very boxy.  I don't want to get yet another dedicated camera bag, and it doesn't fit into any of my laptop backpacks or satchels very well.  It's not a big camera, it's just not very flat in any 2 dimensions, so just... awkward.<br /><br />All in all, this was a fantastic value, and hopefully a gateway into better photography.  I'll update this review after delving more into the finer points of the camera.<br /><br />Update (9/3/2013): I see the price has gone up past $250, and the 'super zooms' have gone to 50X.  Having done some sports stadium shooting from the back fence to full zoom on the field, I can capture closeups of plays, even fastballs leaving the pitcher's hand from 200-300ft away, so I'm more than happy with 30X, and the stability is very impressive, at least in full daylight (perfect conditions).  Still need to test at, say, nighttime concerts, but I still think this is an excellent value, even in the $250 range, and a steal for under $200."

What I got was a camera that is bigger, although still quite light, with just about the same capabilities. I am by no means a camera expert, but after having a few people look at my settings, etc, in an effort to determine if there were any way to make this camera work for what I was looking for, it was determined that this camera was just not meant for motion or low light. Continous shooting is a joke, if by continous it means that you can take a picture about every 2-3 seconds depending on light and other elements, sure. Definitely not going to catch that came winning goal shot if that is what you are hoping for. Low light, while slightly better then the old digital camera, really isn't anything impressive, either. The zoom function is quite impressive, but keep in mind that you need to have a steady hand to get the full effect. I am returning this camera, and instead am going to try the Nikon Coolpix L820 in hopes of finding a camera in this price range that lives up to the hype they spout regarding action/low light shots."

I was very surprised to find that the PowerShot (and I'm guessing other point & shoots) are so much more complicated to use than the DSL's.<br />Pro's: Price is right, it's light and compact and easy to carry around, additional batteries are reasonable (15$ for 2), it has fun features that take the place of specialty lenses, and when you get a good shot, it's a really good shot.<br />Con's: It can be difficult to get it to focus where you want it to focus, many times it tells you subject is in focus and it's not, features don't always work when telephoto is engaged and the battery has a short lifespan (90 minutes and/or about 200 photos. however the batteries are small and cheap enough that it's easy to have extra available to switch out.)<br />I'm still playing around with the different shooting modes and hopefully will get in sync with it for consistently good shots. The advanced user manual is okay...but it must be for several cameras because it tells me to go to things on the menu that I don't have icons for on my camera. It has been helpful though.<br />Update: I've found shooting in 'Live' mode, all the features work and am getting much more consistant quality. Equal to what I get with my DSL. You definitely want to turn on the AF Point Zoom feature to magnify the focus area and make sure the camera is focusing where you think it is.

But if you are a photography purist, don't even waste your time with this product.  First of all, if you're such a purist, you shouldn't even be looking in this price range.  Move up to the Rebel 70D, and don't try to impress the masses with your higher than average expectations not being met by a camera that costs less than the lens of a Rebel 70D.  That being said, you will get satisfactory pictures, if you are a being a tourist, attending a party, or out with the family.  This isn't a camera that will photograph a still hummingbird, and it will not give you good, large format, poster-quality pictures either.  First of all, it adds lots of fake color pixels, which become visible once you zoom in to your pictures on your computer.  The quality of the image is also not the best, as the images can look rather grainy when you expand them to their correct size on your screen.  What do you get then?  Well, you get beautiful 5x7 album pictures, and you might even get a decent 11x17 small poster.  Beyond that, you should not consider this camera as an option.  If you're going to a hockey game, you might also want to steer clear from this camera.  Especially in auto mode, the camera takes up to three full seconds to focus and shoot a picture.  Even in TV mode where you are supposedly in control of the shutter speed, it is very slow to react.  This is not the best camera for a sporting event, that's for sure.  Also, make sure you purchase a memory card, as the camera does not have one included.  The camera will perform very well in low light conditions, and it has a very decent zoom for a camera this small.  Speaking of small, this camera will not fit in your pockets.  But it is small enough that it didn't bother me to carry it on my hand.<br /><br />Overall I give the camera a 4 star rating, mostly because in its native image mode of 4608x3456 pixels, the images appear slightly blurred.  That's because the actual resolution of this camera is rather low, 180 dots-per-inch.  For the kind of money you'll be spending, you will be able to keep beautiful, natural-colored, and vivid album pictures.  And that's OK with me if you're just being a tourist, and you'd rather not get whacked in the head over a Leica, or regretting for a long time that your children forgot your EOS 5D Mark III in a bathroom stall."

The auto settings were taking some very washed out pictures. If I control everything manually I could get some really good ones, but having to do that when all you want is to snap and take some good pictures is a pain. So I ended up having to do that for much of my vacation, and then I also had to manually edit some pictures after the fact. The shutter is super slow also, and you have to hold the shutter button for a while for the picture to snap. Also I don't like having to manually pop up the flash, seems like it should just pop up by itself. I was going to return the camera when I got back but ended up taking too long and now it's past the return policy date. Bummer, I am really not happy with it. Also the battery goes down very fast, couldn't go for 2 days of shooting without having to charge it."

Things have changed, quickly and dramatically for the worse...After using the camera roughly 20 times since it arrived, the zoom has stopped working, which renders the camera useless. And as luck would have it, although i am a Prime member for 3 years, I am unable to return the product. I still have the original packaging (it conveniently did not arrive with a printed receipt, which I notice happens frequently with my purchases through Amazon). Perhaps an oversight on their part... I have recommended Amazon to family, coworkers and friends and have purchased thousands and thousands of dollars worth of merchandise through Amazon. I will no longer buy from Amazon after this experience due to my complete dissatisfaction with this camera and their convoluted return policy. Basically I  have a 200 dollar useless trinket and gave my old camera away so I can no longer take photos, which is something I enjoy tremendously. Thanks Amazon (not so much)..."

It was to upgrade my Canon IS3000 with a mere 5x zoom.  I also own a Sony camcorder with 70x zoom.  So far what ever I seem to do with the Canon SX 500 it is running circles around my Sony Camcorder.  My conclution now is that Sony does NOT make very good cameras.  The ZOOM on the SX 500 is absolutely fantastic.  Nice and smooth both in Still and Movie mode and the clarity is absolutely fantastic at 30x.  The only distortion really might be from my jumping up and down because the view is so good, because my Sony doesnt even come close to looking this good at ANY ZOOM LENGTH.... lol..  still pictures are crisp and a joy to look at on this sharp three inch screen.  Its easy to use but the only thing is make sure when your in the AUTO MODE the tracking automatically turns on... and the green box goes all over the screen to look for something to shoot at and while it does that it shuffles through all the mode choices... at first I thought it was a defect until I realized I HAD TO SET THE BOX AT THE AREA I WANTED TO SHOOT AT.... and you do that by pushing the top arrow button to select the shot...but I like the program mode the best... lets see... whats bad about it... well it is a lil bulky not bad, but requires a case.  And the neck strap is lame, it gets in the way of all your hands and the screen... I took it off am going to buy a hand strap here at Amazon and I DONT LIKE LENS COVERS, I like the ones that close automatically, but oh well...  I suggest buying an extra battery with maybe a car charger, because this camera because of its technology is going to use up more battery life probley than just the 190 pictures a charge they say you can get with this.  Remember they dont take in to account your viewing time and sometimes that can be extensive."

I upgraded to the 5d mark iii from a Canon 7D mainly because of lighting issues.

With the 5d mark iii I am able to kick up my iso to 6400 and still get clean video! I love it. I always say, “if you’re going to produce something, why not produce the best that you can”… With the 7D I had a lot of struggles with lighting and trying to keep my iso low to avoid grain. Also, the wide frame is perfect for wedding videos. Yeah, I have to get a bit closer on certain shots, but overall I am in love with this camera. It’s a solid well built machine."

I toyed around with the 6D and it is certainly a fantastic camera (handles well, feels comfortable to hold and creates great images). However, coming from the canon 30D, I felt more at home with control layout on the 5D3. I prefer more controls at my fingers instead of in menus. Secondly, I preferred the autofocus capability of the 5D3. I certainly do not think this warrants the price difference between the two cameras but price was not a limiting factor for me. After 3 weeks of use, this camera meets my expectations. For the price though, I wish it had the WIFI capability of the 6D - I use the EYE-FI PRO cards which works great for me -gives me both wifi and geo tagging functionality.<br /><br />Overall a great camera - about $500 too expensive, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.

Except for the film cameras, which I focused myself mostly, this is the first DSLR I have owned that can focus correctly most of the time. That is, it just works. What I'm talking about is critical focus -- being /right/ on. Not close enough for f/5.6, but ON. And this camera nails it most of the time. My 7D could maybe do that 20% of the time.<br /><br />2) For the price and sensor quality, this camera is perhaps disappointed compared to the comparable and current Nikons. But I've got to say that as a /camera/ in terms of performance and handling, it really is better than the sum of its parts. It works very well. You can tell that it's been very thought out. A lot of that thinking is &#34;incremental&#34; and so perhaps not thrilling to the gear head, but overall, the 5D3 is a great machine for getting the job done.<br /><br />Yeah, I wish it had better DR.

I have an old Nikon D50 from 2005 that I thought was awesome in its day but once I started shooting again I grabbed the Canon 7D about 3 years ago and never looked back.  I have now moved to full frame and had been struggling on deciding Nikon D800e or Canon 5D MIII.  I have a friend with the Nikon so I got to play with it a bit.  Needless to say I like the product but like my 7D more when it came to speed and versatility.  On a leap of faith I decided to go with the 5D MIII as it seemed to be close to the 7D in operation.  I care about the best all around pictures also and sites like DXOMark really kept me holding out on the 5D MIII as the Nikon D800 and D800e rock the charts.  I want to say right not those charts are not everything.  I get great shots on the 5D mark III ( better then my 7D) and I liked the shots out of my 7D better than my friends Nikon D800e at the time I used it and even now based on what she takes.  I know some Nikon fans are going to flame what I just said but this was just based on my one time use of the D800e (which was not as comfortable for me to use).  I also did not sit down and do test with equivalent lenses.  My 7D has some really nice prime L glass I use and the Nikon had a zoom lens at the time.  I have seen some awesome shots come from that thing so I know it does the job but now when I see the Canon 5D (straight out of cam) shots it seems to appeal to me.  I usually shoot RAW so this is RAW not jpeg.  When I tested jpeg it seems Canon still has the old edge it had before with how the in cam software cleans up.<br /><br />It boils down to the 5D MIII being better then I expected and as versatile as my needs require.  I'm sure in time I would have been happy with the D800e but I can't say I would be as happy as I am now.<br /><br />I'm no a fan of any brand but I do like some things that each company does.  What I would give for a 5DMIII that has the resolution and dynamic range potential of a D800e or a D800e that has the great Software ISO enhancement and FPS of the 5DMIII.  I take mostly event stuff so ultra high 36MP does not help me but it would be awesome to have, says the geek in me."

The answer came back as a quick 'yes.'<br />  So, next question: 'Since my Canon 40D turned out to be such a pile of... of... of... um... 'feces' should I go with Canon again?' The answer came as a 'no' followed by a 'but.' You see, although I am not a professional photographer, I did manage to get suckered into purchasing a bunch of really expensive Canon lenses over the years. SO as much as I would have loved to switch to Nikon, buying a new set of high-end lenses would prove to be prohibitive.<br />  My musings were interrupted by another notice of 'Error99' by my Canon40D, indicating that either I buy a new camera, or I should be prepared to shell out another ~250-300 for repair of the old one. And, given my investment in Canon lenses, it will have to be another Canon. With heavy heart, I searched the internet for a new camera, reading the reviews of available Canon products, and finally settled on Canon EOS 5D Mark III.<br />  The  camera arrived 10 days ago and I am glad to report that, despite my dismal experience with its 40D predecessor, '5D MarkIII' appears to be an almost different (and better) animal. Here is my, amateur take on it. So far.<br />PROs:<br />  -- shooting at mind-bogglingly high ISOs does make need for a flash so last-century<br />  -- crisp-edge images<br />  -- sturdy body<br />  -- more intuitive interface<br />  -- marginal changes of buttons and dials compared to prior versions of Canon SLRs, making<br />  conversion from my old 40D to this new beastie a breeze.<br />CONs:<br />  -- the prices is an absolute downer! Judging by the impressions I got from reading numerous posts on countless forums and blogs (and my own feelings about this new purchase) I'd rather have NO video capability (which, in this model, lacks an intuitive dynamic AutoFocus and, therefore, seriously limits the use of this feature), NO dual card use (in Mark III one can use two different media cards, but um... so what?...), and FEWER other cosmetic bells and whistles if it meant ~$1000 less for the camera. Of course this is just my personal opinion..."

It's way too simplistic to say that the camera makes the picture ... because a great photographer can take amazing shots with an iPhone ... lighting, framing ... lots more to a shot than the camera.<br /><br />But I will say that with the 5D in my hands I haven't taken a bad shot. I've done some sessions for friends, and through word of mouth I've gotten inquiries for some paid shoots and have done a few (so I guess I'm borderline past hobbyist).<br /><br />Also, the low light performance is INSANE.

My subjects don't sit still or have a lot of patience, so AF speed and accuracy and general handling are big for me. That's why I never was a big fan of the 5D Mark II; I always considered the 7D the better camera of the two, its sensor size disadvantage being more than compensated for by the better AF system and ergonomics. All this changed with the arrival of the 5D Mark III, of which I am now a happy owner, after two rentals made me a convert.<br /><br />My experiences: AF is vastly improved over the 7D; with fast lenses (135 f/2L, 24-70 f/2.8L II, and others) I can shoot wide open and focus is exactly where I want it to be.  AI servo is a treat to use, and I find myself taking more action shots than I ever did before. Shutter lag is almost non-existent, and I have been able to get shots of dancers in mid air consistently through pure timing without using the burst mode. Noise levels are much lower. With the 7D, I'd worry about using ISO800, but with the Mark III, ISO 3200 and even higher is very usable. Finally, even at low ISOs, it seems like the 5D captures more detail than the 4.3 MP advantage over the 7D would seem to indicate. If there is one minor complaint, it is that the jpg photos straight from the camera look a little flat. I believe this is due to very aggressive NR being applied in camera. Shooting RAW results in large files that take noticeably longer to process in Lightroom than my old 7D RAWs. In actual practice, very little if any NR is needed until you get to ISO 1600. Couple this camera with a fast lens, and there is practically no photographic situation that you will not be able to handle.<br /><br />What Canon appears to have done is to combine the ergonomics of the 7D with the IQ of the 5D Mark II - and then, almost impossibly, improve upon the result. What you have is a camera that does its job very, very well, thus allowing you to focus on yours, which is composition, lighting, and timing. Using this camera is, as a friend of mine put it, like a tiger getting its first taste of human blood. Once you see how much better it is than anything else you've used, nothing less will do.<br /><br />Update May 2014: Nearly a year after purchasing this camera I feel compelled to add a few more words. Because this camera does what it does so well, it has improved my photography beyond all expectation; it is an absolute joy to simply have to concentrate on the scene and have complete confidence that the camera will capture in beautiful detail what your eyes and mind perceive; I never had this level of trust in the 7D or the 450D.  I want to emphasize again the difference in sharpness and contrast between the RAW files and the in camera JPGs. The in camera JPGs use horrendously destructive noise reduction even at very low ISO values. Make doubly certain you are shooting in RAW for anything that is critical."

As a wedding shooter, I count on my equipment and need things to work correctly.<br /><br />I had purchased two nikon d600's 1 year apart and both had the horrible dust/debris issue. After repeat cleanings and 20,000+ shots, both cameras still had the issue. I got tired of wet cleaning the sensors and got tired of nikons poor customer service. Nikon decided that the D600 owners just had to either deal with repeat sensor cleanings or send in the camera to 'possibly' have the issue resolved. Nikon had no proven fix besides switching out the shutter and praying that the issue went away. Nikon released the d610 and left the rest of the people hanging.<br /><br />Leaving nikon was extremely difficult for me because I had a big investment in the bodies, accessories and glass. I made the move at a huge loss but am extremely happy that I did.<br /><br />The differences:<br /><br />I purchased both a 6D and the 5D mark III from amazon. The immediate thing that I have noticed is that all my canon glass has been good with focus right out of the box. With almost every nikon lens/camera combo, I had to pull out a focus chart and focus tune software and apply fine tuning. I also noticed that the focus system on my canons do not have the tendency to act up under tungsten lighting like my nikons did. My d600's and d7000 had a tendency to back-focus under heavy tungsten lighting.<br /><br />The canon DPP software is a pleasure to use. I hated Nikon capture NX2. It was slow and the user interface was horrible. Canon DPP loads quickly and applying batch changes is amazing. I do miss the Nik software selection point feature of CNX2.<br /><br />The one thing I don't like is the fact that canon makes you purchase your lens hoods separately and at a premium.<br /><br />I do like the fact that the canon equipment is made in japan and has a quality feel to it compared to cameras like the d600 that are made in Thailand.<br /><br />The 5D mark iii vs D800:<br /><br />Prior to leaving nikon, I also spent a week with the nikon D800. I found that the d800 produced a lot of noise in the raw files when pushed to higher iso's. This alone was enough to turn me off. I did test my sample of the d800 for left focus issues. I did not have the left AF issue of older d800's but the camera I got had some focus issues that required fine tuning all my glass to the body. In some cases the fine tune was at +20.<br /><br />The D800 files did have a lot of detail and dynamic range but the file size was huge. If you shoot a lot of landscape and want lots of dynamic range, the d800 is a good option. But the dynamic range comes at the cost of nikons lack of quality control.<br /><br />If dynamic range is not your main goal but want a great reliable camera with a killer AF system (better in my testing) and smaller files, the canon 5D mark III is amazing. I suggest not to get caught up in the megapixel game unless you do some very heavy cropping like birds in flight for which the d800 may be a better choice. The 5D mark III files are great and have plenty of latitude for most users.<br /><br />5D mark III:<br /><br />Focus:<br /><br />Focus Focus Focus. The 5D mark III has a killer focus system. The best that I have used. The focus system is lighting fast, accurate and very very customizable. It is a pleasure to be able to customize my focus system like this. I recently shot an event and out of 700+ images, I scrapped maybe 10 shots because of focus. The ones I did delete because of focus was do to me not placing the focus point on the right area of the image.<br /><br /> No back/front focus like my nikons had. No focus shift under tungsten lighting like some nikons.<br />The hit rate on focus is amazing. You want to know why canon can charge a premium for this camera? Because of its pure amazing focus system! If you absolutely need the best focus system on any camera, this is it.<br /><br />Customization:<br /><br />You can assign buttons to do certain functions and to your own shooting style. This is a god send compared to nikons lack of customization.<br /><br />Body:<br /><br />The camera is solid with a good feel in the hand. The buttons are easy to operate and cleverly located. Coming from nikon is an adjustment because the camera buttons are in a different layout. It will become easy to use after some time and practice.<br /><br />I did not like the fact that canon has no built in removable screen protector like the nikon. This is a minor gripe but one that I resolved by buying the vello stick on glass protectors. I know the nikon plastic screen protectors are not fancy but they did a good job of protecting the screen from bumps.<br /><br />Images:<br /><br />The 5D makr III images are fantastic. The auto white balance works much better compared to my nikons I had owned. The 5D mark III is not able to pull details from the shadows like the D800 or D600 so it is a sacrifice in dynamic range if that is the most important thing to you. Nikon still has canon beat in dynamic range.<br /><br />I will personally will take a in focus, sharp, good out of camera white balance and dust free image out of a canon any day vs a hit and miss focus and dusty d600 image with dynamic range. An out of focus image with dirt is useless to me.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />If you shoot anything that requires this focus system, this reliability and this customization, BUY THIS CAMERA. I found the 5d and 6d is a perfect combo. I use the 6D with the wifi feature when working in a studio paired to an ipad and use the 5D when shooting a wedding or anything that moves at a fast pace.<br /><br />The 5d mark III continues to sell even at the higher price because it is a proven camera and you cant go wrong with it. I love it and will update this review as I use it more. I am glad I left nikon and I hope they learn one day that customer loyalty is earned."

Saved $600. Update.,"Okay, you've heard plenty about this excellent camera already. But if you are getting ready to pull the trigger on the 5D III, keep reading.<br /><br />I'm a photojournalist and missed the recent Black Friday deals and rebates (grump!) Suddenly my work changed and I simply HAD to replace my current 5D II bodies with two 5D III bodies. I saved about $600 by checking out the 'used' deals. I bought two completely NEW, UNUSED cameras that simply had the 24-105 kit lens removed from the box. Everything else was in there, unopened, and the cameras untouched with the original warranty.<br /><br />I've shot hundreds of assignments with the 5D III cameras and am loving the heck out of them! Compared to the 5D II, the 5D III offers far superior focusing, better low light sensitivity and six frames per second. The 'quiet' shooting mode works great at concerts, churches and other venues where you need to remain inconspicuous. The single drawback is that Canon crippled the SD card slot rendering SD almost useless for action photography. With that one exception, it is what the 5D II should have been.<br /><br />Update: after a year of professional shooting, I'm more pleased than ever with my two 5D III bodies. Low light sensitivity appears to be a solid two stops better than the 5D II, and the little-discussed 'quiet' mode for shooting is a wonderful addition for working during plays, concerts, churches, etc."

The Mark II had really served me well, but I didn't have rain protection on one of my photo tours this year and during the week of intense rains here in Colorado, the Mark II gave out after being in the rain for 2 days. I needed a camera right away while my Mark II went in for repairs.<br /><br />I decided to go with the Mark III since it used compact flash and also I wanted the upgraded 61-point focusing system and the faster frame rate.  Both the Mark III and the 6D have the new Digic 5+ processor which is amazing but the Mark III can shoot at a full 6fps allowing me to use the camera in more action related situations and so I didn't need to purchase a 2nd camera for the occasional sporting events I was shooting.<br /><br />On my last photo tour we did some astro photography just outside of Crested Butte Colorado on Ohio Pass and the result was some amazing images at ISO 5000 with little to no noise! I literally was able to use image right out of the camera with no post noise reduction.<br /><br />I also shoot portraits and occasionally I get requests to shoot the kids in action. I went to one of the high school football games to capture of few of my students in action on the football field and I was able to shoot at ISO 12800 so I could capture the players in action with a fast enough shutter speed. This in combination with 6fps gave me clean crisp images. Post noise reduction was minimal.  The 5D Mark II would never have been able to match this camera's performance.  Iso 6400 on the Mark II is loaded with noise so 12800.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the fact that the SD card slot is not UDMA-7 compatible and will only support write speeds of 133X.  If you want to shoot fast with no buffering then don't use the SD card slot.  Stick to the compact flash. When you pair this camera with the Lexar 1000X  or San Disk Extreme Pro CF cards it can shoot all day long at 6fps and you never notice any buffering.<br /><br />I love the new beefier body and grip.  It feels really good in the hands and ever better than the Mark II.  Though it is heavier, I love the magnesium body. This camera is much more solid and tight sealing than my Mark II, though during my trip to Telluride I made sure I had rain and snow protection for the camera.<br /><br />The price is high for this camera, but I'm totally happy with my purchase. I'm glad I didn't settle for the 6D. The new 61-point focusing system and the 6fps frame rate made this the right purchase for me, plus the fact that I could take advantage of my already huge investment in compact flash cards I already owned and didn't have to move to new SD cards.<br /><br />Love this investment in my business!

I didn't know what I was missing in a full frame.<br /><br />First off, some people will not like the pictures this camera takes without post processing.  You might ask why, as this camera has in camera processing, excellent resolution, great noise reduction and amazing color.  Well, those are all the 'problems'.  This camera is so good, it shows every blemish on the subject.  Every mark, every wrinkle, every strand of hair and every spec of dirt will be in the picture.<br /><br />Now that we got past that part, lets talk full frame.  Some people like the crop factor of the smaller sensors, especially on telephoto.  I was one of them.  I was psyched to have the ef-70-200mm L IS on my 7d as it was like having a 320mm at the long end.  What I learned was I am not losing anything in zoom with the full frame, but gaining more of the picture on the short end. If I crop the picture on the 5DM3, I can 'zoom' in on the picture to any point I want and the resolution is so good, it actually looks much better overall.<br /><br />There is truth in the fact that you don't need a billion megapixels to make a good image.  The sensor is larger, so you would think you would want more mp overall, but the larger pixels gather more light, reduce noise and are just sharper.<br /><br />What I found is that I told myself that my crop sensor was awesome because I have all L glass and the pictures looked amazing. Then, when I paired that same glass with the full frame, I find it hard to want to pick up the 7d again.<br /><br />So, let me sum it up.  The 5DM3 is an amazing camera and I am not a good enough photographer to make use of all of the features and awesomeness Canon put in my hands.  Its not all about the equipment, I know people that shoot amazing shots with a point and shoot, but for me, it is one more cool tool in the tool box.<br /><br />5 Stars from me.  I love my 5DM3."
Canon,Canon EOS 5D Mark III 22.3 MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera with EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens,20130430,B007FGZ1V0,5,7,9,"on April 30, 2013",ANONYMOUS,Upgrade from 7D,"I bought a 7D two years ago as my entry to the world of high-end DSLRs.  The camera's engineering and ergonomics were awesome and it produced some great images for me.  However, that full-frame sensor on the 5D has been calling my name ever since.  I sold the 7D on ebay last month and bought a Mark III.  If any 7D owner is wondering whether the upgrade is worth the price, I say absolutely.  The camera operates almost exactly like my 7D and so I had little or no learning curve.  In some ways, the interface is improved (sub-menus, for example).  The rear screen gives a better view of the finished picture.  So what did I get besides a camera that works as I expect?  Image quality.  In spades.  The full-frame sensor is magnificent, and with the 35MM 1.4L lens and the 2.8 24-70 L II lens, produces incredibly sharp, detailed images.  Seriously beautiful stuff.  The camera brings out the best in 'L' glass -- I see it in the images, but look at the DXO ratings for confirmation.  The 2.8 24-70 lens gives me better results in almost all shooting modes than I got on the 7D.  The extra usable ISO makes up for the lack of IS on the 2.8 lens -- but since grandchildren are often the subjects, IS is not much use anyway. The focus system is much more accurate and easily controlled and the images (I use RAW) require less post-processing than with the 7D. There will be some additional distortion and light falloff in the corners, but with LR, PS, or DXO these problems disappear on RAW images with the click of a button. I would often start editing a picture from the 7D and puzzle about what it needed to 'pop' -- the 5D's added dynamic range and its metering system produce images that are closer to 'right' at first look. I have far less need to adjust exposure, contrast, and WB than I typically did with the 7D.  An impressive pickup is the wider usable ISO range of the larger sensor.  I didn't want to go much above ISO 800 on the 7D because of noise, but I am getting several additional (3-4) stops before seeing much noise with the 5D.  This makes the camera almost perfect for indoors available-light shooting. So, I have a camera that is as familiar to me as my 7D, and as well-engineered, but produces significantly better images. While I wouldn't have been comfortable using the 7D in auto-ISO mode, I can do so with the 5D.  This body was twice the money of the 7D but is equally refined in terms of build quality, engineering, ergonomics, and the image quality of the 5D III matches the rest of the engineering. The sensor may not have the high pixel count of some of the Nikon's, but the sensor has artistic chops. It can produce breathtaking detail, sharpness, and color."

It took me some time and learning and this was a great beginner camera.  Eventually I had good quality glass and some know how and the 7D grabbed my attention.  I bought my 7D in 2010 and haven't had a camera more than 1 year since.  Then the 5D Mark III was introduced.  I have been longing for it ever since.  I was able to pick one up about 2 months ago and I positively love it.  There are plenty of reviews here and elsewhere that cover the camera in detail, so I will focus on comparing it to my last 2 cameras; the 7D and the 5D Mark II.<br /><br />AF:<br /><br />I bought this camera for the AF system.  If the 5D2 had a focus system similar to the 7D, I probably would have stuck with it. If the 7D had been full frame, I would have stuck with it.  I loved the way the 7D AF system worked, so I was thrilled to see they brought the 5D series up in this regard.  The focus system lives up to my expectations.<br /><br />High ISO Noise:<br /><br />I thought I bought the camera for the AF system.  Then I started taking pictures at higher ISO speeds.  WOW!  I am positively blown away.  The 7D took what I would consider clean shots at ISO 3200 and decent at 6400.  The 5D2 was great at 3200 and reasonably clean at 6400.  The 5D3 is cleaner at 12,800 than the 5D2 was at 6400!  Time and time again I'm blown away.  I already have more shots at 12,800 with the 5D3 than I have at 6400 from either of my past cameras.<br /><br />Ergonomics:<br /><br />Lastly, the 5D3 gets the layout of the 7D with some additional improvements.  The video/live view mode setup is much better than it is on the 5D2.  The M-Fn button is great to have for flipping through AF point modes.  The DoF button set up for toggling drive modes is great.  But most of all, in conjunction with the ISO performance, I can now set the camera to Av mode, leave it on Auto ISO and pretty much forget the rest of my settings.  I set a minimum shutter speed and fire at will.  The results are outstanding and this camera is an absolute joy to use!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />If you have the cash, I would not hesitate to grab this camera if you are really into photography.  I am just a hobbyist, but I cherish the pictures I take of my kids.  Now being able to shoot in low light at ISO 12,800 with good shutter speeds I am getting far more 'keepers' and I honestly don't long for anything more from a camera body.  I believe this one will be with me for longer than I used my 40D."

It’s true. For me, this is a real gain, because if you photograph in door at evening (even using prime lenses, e.g. 1.2 or 1.4) you need to increase the ISO to keep reasonable shutter speed (1/125). Usually, the result is grainer/noisier. This 5D keeps very nice result up to ISO 1600."

First I opted for the Canon 60D...and although it was good...I felt it wasn't the best.  I also didn't care for the whole crop sensor issue as I felt that I had to leave the room just to take a picture of a group of people!  I was shooting with a 50 mm f/1.4 lens at the time.  Forget about taking pictures if there was any sort of space constraint.  So, after a couple of months playing around with the 60D I upgraded to the 5D Mark III.<br /><br />All I can say is AWESOME!<br /><br />The quality of images shot through the roof.  I have several lenses that I use but the 50mm 1.4 and a 40 mm 2.8 are my favorites.  It's like the camera can take just the right picture in any sort of light!  Also, added in the Speedline 430EX flash and now everything looks even better.<br /><br />If you can afford the higher priced Mark III and a decent lens...go for it.  It's worth it.  The other cameras are good too...but you may beg tired of the crop sensor issue.  I've uploaded some of my pictures if you are curious.  And like I said...yes, I'm totally 'that dad.'<br /><br />OK...I lied.  I can't figure out how to add images.  It isn't exactly clear here on Amazon.  Perhaps I can write a review on that?  If there is a kind amazon helper that can assist me with this, I'd really like to add some images. :)"

I used to think that the 5d mkIII was an overpriced camera, that the functionality wasn't there to justify the cost. I was wrong on every count. This camera is a beast in it's own right. With Magic Lantern installed, it's the best value in DSLR's hands-down. I can shoot RAW at 1080, and while the quality might not rival the Arri or Black Magic, it is certainly in the same ballpark and a massive improvement over H.264. The expanded dual-iso mode has simplified my real estate workflow 10-fold. The new AF is crisp, responsive and accurate. Build quality is superb, and ergonomics were carefully thought out. Coming from the 50d, I resent having to invest in full-frame glass but I would make the investment again if I had to. If you can't afford to take the plunge, wait and save. It will be worth it in the long run."

The U.S. version should have a lot of different languages to choose. But still, this is a good camera and also a good deal."

I know nothing about photography and don't own many gadgets.  But, before you decide that that automatically means my review can't mean much, hear me out.<br /><br />I've been wanting to start a blog and wanted to use my own pictures and videos.  I just wanted something with decent quality and was easy to use.  All of my research led me to first choose Canon over every other brand.  Then I found this camera.  It was in the under $200 category, which was more than I wanted to spend.  But, the more results I found online for this camera's videos and photos, I was hooked.  I bought it (at a Best Buy Midnight Sale for $149) and have had so much fun with it.  The first night I got it, I decided to take a walk and snap some pictures using ONLY the automatic settings.  When I came back and uploaded the images to my computer, I couldn't believe how great they looked!<br /><br />I went to a photography forum, posted my untouched photos, told how I just bought the camera and asked for opinions about it.  I got nothing but rave reviews about the camera and shock that the photos were my first attempt at photography.  They called them &#34;saleable&#34;  and I was encouraged to look into selling them.  Someone guided me along with how to do it and, guess what?  I sold them!<br /><br />My point is this:  I might have a little natural talent when it comes to composition, but the quality was ALL in the camera... and ONLY on the automatic settings!  Imagine what this camera can do when I learn how to use the manual settings!<br /><br />UPDATED ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2013:  I thought I'd pop in and let everyone know that this camera STILL works great!  I haven't had a single problem with it!  As a matter of fact, it lasted longer than my blog did!  LOL  And I never did learn how to use the manual settings because the AUTO settings have never failed me.  I bought a larger memory card for it but still don't understand why I can't record more than 10 minutes of video at a time.  I even lowered the quality of the video but that didn't make any difference.  That's my only complaint about this camera.  I can't seem to record more than 10 minutes of video at a time before the camera automatically shuts off.<br /><br />UPDATED ON OCTOBER 18, 2015:  The camera sat in a box for almost a year because I didn't need it.  In the last six months, I've been using it on the job on a daily basis.  Still NO problems and NO signs of wearing out.  It still works like brand new.  I'm impressed."

I had a Canon 6 MP and wanted to update to a 12 MP or higher and I wanted to stay with the Canon brand so I checked out what they had. This little camera just stood out for me. The first thing that attracted me was the color, but that aside, it does great in low light, just like it says and you can choose to shoot totally automatic or switch it over to manual and either choose one of the preset shooting modes or just adjust your own settings. It has a great 3' viewing area and the controls are very similar to my old Canon so it was pretty easy to move over to this one. I find myself grabbing more for this one now, than my old one. It takes great pictures and I like that I can use the larger storage memory cards. The handle is about the only thing that they could have done better on. My old camera has a nice, flexable, soft handle with a sliding part where you can make the handle opening larger or smaller. This new one has a stiffer, vinyl like handle with no adjustment for the opening. It just seems a bit cheeper to me, but the camera itself is amazing. If you want a camera that will do it all for you, this is great for that. I am very satisfied with it's quality and the quality of the pictures it takes. Canon is a good brand.<br />One note: it does not come with a memory card so I had to buy that separately. It does come with the battery and the battery charger, as well as the software though.<br />As usual, Amazon did a great job with the whole transaction.

The photos from the SD800 IS are not as clean as the photos of the older A-model Canons with slightly larger sensors and lower megapixels, but the photos are reasonably sharp and the SD800 IS is more compact than my older A models for everyday carry.  However, small cameras with small flashes with limited flash range would benefit from better low-light-higher-ISO capabilities -- my SD800 IS takes photos at ISO 1600 that look quite grainy or noisy.  So I decided to check out the Canon HS models for the low-light-high-ISO capabilities.  I wanted an HS model that was smaller than my SD800 and I did not want to pay too much for a camera that I was not completely sure about, so I put the cheapest ELPH 100 HS model in my Amazon.com cart.  When the price dropped by $20 and Super Saver Shipping was offered, I ordered the 100 HS in April and have been carrying the camera as my everyday camera and using it for nine weeks.<br /><br />The 100 HS is lighter and much thinner than my SD800, although it is actually a little longer.  The screen is much bigger and takes up most of the back of the camera -- it is great for reviewing photos.  But the control wheel is smaller and is a little trickier to use -- I kept pressing the wrong way and needed additional attempts to get things changed.  With fewer external controls on the back than the SD800, the 100 HS required more use of the menus.  The smaller size of the 100 HS is an important attraction for me, but it comes with some disadvantages -- there is little to grab onto, so I use the wrist strap to help in avoiding drops.<br /><br />In low light, the higher ISO capabilities of the 100 HS have been impressive.  The photos look really less grainy or noisy and the colors have looked pretty good.  However, zooming in on the photos reveal soft images and lack of detail, so the noise reduction results in loss of sharpness.  Photos taken with the flash within the limited flash range and lower ISO are noticeably sharper than the photos taken without the flash and higher ISO.  Although I used to see reviews that said that ELPH cameras produced photos that were very sharp, the reviews on the 100 HS indicate that its resolution is a bit low and is average at best, not sharp, so the high ISO noise reduction appears to be only part of the reason why the photos look so soft.  My SD800 IS, which is not the sharpest camera out there, produces sharper looking photos than the 100 HS.<br /><br />When I decided to use the 100 HS's flash more from within the flash's range in order to get sharper photos, I encountered another problem -- the flash photos showed a color cast and were less pleasing than the photos taken without the flash.  This was surprising to me, because I have not gotten this result with any of my other Canon cameras -- so I had to do some color correction with Adobe Photoshop Elements.  After getting that screwy flash color result, I compared the colors of photos taken under different lighting conditions taken with the 100 HS and the SD800.  The SD800 produced photos with more accurate colors than the 100 HS.  However, the difference is only noticeable if you compare the photos taken with the 100 HS against photos taken of the same objects with other cameras or if you compare the photos with the original objects photographed, so the 100 HS's colors may be satisfactory to you, especially if you use the 'Vivid' or other color setting.<br /><br />Because I usually print photos in the 4X6-inch size, I set the aspect ratio at 3:2 instead of 4:3.  When I changed the aspect ratio, I lost the digital zoom.  I learned from Canon that the digital zoom works only in the 4:3 aspect ratio.  As others have already pointed out, the optical zoom of the 100 HS is not available for video, so any zooming has to be with the digital zoom.  If you set the 100 HS for the aspect ratio 3:2 or 16:9 and you plan to zoom during a video with the digital zoom, you should set the aspect ratio to 4:3 before starting the video.<br /><br />After reading more comments and reviews, I concluded that there is a price paid for the compactness and low-light capabilities of this camera.  Other cameras that are a bit bigger may be better suited for those who are looking for a primary camera.  For family and office events, I have my other Canons and my Nikon D90 SLR to use, so I do not have to rely only on the ELPH 100 HS.  If a compact Canon ELPH is nevertheless desired, I would suggest that a 300 HS for about $50 more should be considered."
Canon,Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom (Blue),20110616,B004J3V7RO,2,9,16,"on June 16, 2011",ANONYMOUS,Not really impressed.,"I bought this camera from a local Staples store, and then a couple of days later I took it back to that store for a refund. I already knew that the ELPH100 disabled the zoom when in movie mode; that was no problem since I'm not a fan of zooming in and out while the video is rolling. What I didn't know was that the autofocus is also crippled. Now, what good is a point and shoot camera that doesn't maintain focus?<br /><br />The whole point of a point and shoot is that you can point it at something and get a decent picture--or video--without having to waste time fumbling around with settings while the action around you passes by. After all, life waits for no one. Especially children or grandchildren.<br /><br />If it was just the movie-autofocus problem, I would have been tempted to keep the darn thing, and I was close to doing just that. But no...I had to go ahead and test the pointy-eared, little ELPH's picture quality against my old, 5MP, brick-like, troll-of-a-Sony. (Seriously! With its fat, weighty little, metal body; you could really hurt someone with that ancient thing if you whipped it around by its wrist strap.)<br /><br />The picture quality of the Canon ELPH isn't really that bad, but when you consider that it has a technological leap of seven or eight years over the clunky Sony, it's far less than impressive. The outdoor shots looked harsh and the highlights more than a little blown out. And the colors? Well, our green garbage can looked yellower than I ever imagined it. Sure, the sun was bright on that day here in Florida, but my old Sony Cybershot didn't seem to have a problem with it. Colors with the Sony looked much more natural and as true as one of these cheap little cameras can get.<br /><br />Some might say that it's not fair to judge the Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 solely on its preset, automatic features. To that, I say again; isn't that the point of a point and shoot?"

My last Canon PS1200 was stolen at Disneyland, otherwise I would've never bought a new one - that was a great camera! But now that I have this one I'm realizing how far Canon has come in just a few short years! My one and only complaint is the terrible wrist strap! But that's an easy fix."

There are a lot of good products from which to choose.<br /><br />I next went to Best Buy, Office Depot, and Sears to hold different point-and-shoot cameras made by the major producers:  Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, etc.  For me, these visits to different retailers is an important part of the process of buying a point-and-shoot digital camera for the first time.<br /><br />Another important step is to learn whether or not the camera's software is compatible with your desktop computer.  Because my computer is old (2006), I had to research compatibility with the different cameras that I liked.  You can find the information at the product websites.<br /><br />Canon has a very user-friendly website that influenced my purchase considerably.<br /><br />I had XP Service Pack 2 on an older Dell Dimension E310.  For the Canon, I had to download XP Service Pack 3.<br /><br />I ordered the camera from Amazon.com.  From the moment I opened the box of the Canon ELPH 100 HS, I liked everything that I saw.  The instructions are clear and organized well.<br /><br />Finally, I love the pictures that I am taking.  No, they are not the same quality as those taken by friends and family members who own thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment.  However, these photos are beautiful and fun to take.<br /><br />I am practicing now so that I will be ready to take photos at baby showers and graduations in the next couple of weeks.<br /><br />Is it easy to learn how to use the Canon ELPH 100 HS?  It is VERY easy to learn how to use Smart AUTO.  The sliding Smart AUTO button is on the top of the camera:  you slide the latch to Smart AUTO, and you are finished.  The camera 'decides' whether or not to activate flash and also determines other settings.<br /><br />To learn to use all of the optional features (P mode) is fun but not essential to photographing great photos right away.<br /><br />Another reason that I bought the Canon ELPH 100 is that it is considered to be among the best in its price range -- and possibly THE BEST -- in low-light conditions.  The only time the colors seemed to be distorted somewhat was when I took photos of pets sitting in a semi-darkened room while they were directly under the strong light of a table lamp.  I found that the bright light from the lamp washed over all objects close to the lamp; the objects outside of the lamplight were fainter in color.  Since then, I've taken the precaution of composing photos more carefully so that I am not creating a spotlight effect.<br /><br />I read that the ELPH 300 could be a better choice if you plan to use the video features a lot.  For me, the video features on the ELPH 100 are fine.<br /><br />While in Playback (viewing photos that I have taken), I am learning how to use the displayed menus to select options such as Slideshow and Erase -- so far, so good.  While not as easy as Smart Auto, the menus are fairly intuitive.<br /><br />I have been very pleased.  The sheen of the dog's coat, the warm expression in her eyes, and the mysterious, bold gaze of the cat -- all captured beautifully."

This camera did not have any of these qualities.  The pictures I took were washed out.  The camera menu was not simple.  You have to push down on the button very hard and hold it to take a picture and then it takes so long for the photo to actually shoot that your subject has moved.  I was very disappointed and am returning immediately.

It is tiny, even for an Elph, and the photos are far better than any previous Elph I've owned.  (I've owned four now.)  The screen is nice and big, although it got a scratch within 1 week... something that had never happened to any of my previous Elphs over a period of 10 years.  I guess that's what happens when the glass is so huge.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is about the ridiculously tiny controls.  I have slender fingers and can use most small electronics without a problem.  This is VERY HARD to use because the buttons are EXTREMELY small.  The D-pad is barely usable.  Fortunately, the flip side is that the automated scene selection feature has been improved so much that you almost never have to use the D-pad or other controls.  Basically, I just shoot in auto mode all the time and all the photos come out fine.  Once in a while, I'll switch to the program mode so I can shoot the kids running around, but mostly I don't need the controls any more.  This was a real paradigm shift for me after so many years of constantly adjusting the ISO and exposure of my Elphs to get the lighting just right.<br /><br />Having said that, I am still a habitual deleter of excess photos while they are still in the camera, and the lack of a delete button is a serious design flaw.  To delete a single photo, I have to press the ridiculously small buttons 4-5 times.  To delete a bunch of photos, I just sit there pressing (or mis-pressing) buttons for 10 minutes.  I guess if you are the type of person who simply manages your photos after they are on the computer, you won't have this problem.  But my spouse is always filling up the memory card, and then I end up having to delete dozens of pix or movies to make more space on the camera.<br /><br />I guess the only other flaw I would point out is that the camera is so small, and the glass is so large, there's almost no way to take a photo without sticking your thumb directly on the glass and smearing it.<br /><br />These are all somewhat minor gripes compared to the quality of the images that the camera takes and the benefits of having such a compact camera.  I also love the color options so that I no longer get my camera mixed up with someone else's.  For the price, this is a really top-notch point and shooter... with 1080p HD!"

I've only had this camera for a few days, but so far it seems to completely fit the bill. Within a few minutes of opening the box I had snapped several great pics, although inadvertently I also took several video clips of the ground too, lol. A few minutes later I had deleted the video clips and emailed the pics to my family to show off my new camera. It really doesn't get much simpler than that. I especially like the large viewing ability as it helps me take pics with a sense of confidence that 'here is the moment' cause I can make out the details so well. I have also printed the pics out on my printer and they are good, although darker than it appears on screen - but perhaps this is my printer, not the camera. I have to play around with that. I have heard others express concern about taking pics in low light with this camera, but I haven't tried that yet. Over the next month or so I will give the camera a workout as I have 2 granchildren being born within a month of each other. For now, though, I think this camera is perfect for me."

very good choice at that.It has numerous features,alot like the higher class Canon cameras.Like alot of reviews I write I often start with the bad,because when I was researching this camera and others,thats what I wanted to hear first.So thats where Ill start with this one.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Even though I wouldnt say I have huge hands it still felt small in them.If you happen to have smaller hands,male of female,then this wouldnt be a problem.Its more of a preference than it is a knock against the quality of it.I just feel it should still be mentioned.And with that said,you will often find little white fingernail scuff marks on the inside right part of the lens housing,next to the grip.I have heard others complain about the size and awkwardness of the grip and in my opinion that was very trivial.If youre looking for complaints about body and design,much can be said about every camera out there,so to me,I was more interested in the performance.But if you do worry about the design of it,then I will add that it is made of a type of plastic,rather than a alloy like the other higher end Canon cameras are,which again to me,trivial but can be noticed when compared.Back to performance,it is a tad slow on the focusing.Another obstacle I noticed was when taking spontanious pictures often it would go into the self timer due to me accidently pressing one of the buttons and changing the setting.Im not sure I credit that to the size of the body or the simplistic way of altering a feature.Then there is the sensor size.Some will say full frame is better,others swear by cropped sensors.It really all depends on what you want to shoot.Cropped sensors definately have thier place in the world of photography.This camera along with alot of Canon dslr cameras has a sensor crop of 1.6x.Also not the ideal camera for fast action captures.You can time it right and get a great pic,but the slower frame rate per second is somewhat a dilema,especially when filming birds or shooting a sequence of a race car rounding a corner or quaterback throwing a football.The 7 points of focus are adequate but not always enough.There is not a spot metering feature on this camera,but there is a partial metering which is not as bad as some may think.Very much a plus when taking a portrait with alot of backlight.Another 'quark' is that the viewfinder is rather small,which when I started,forced me to use the lcd screen to set exposure and composition,which is not ideal.I now use it to read the histogram,after doing so then Ill adjust accordingly.Just another feature I found useful after learning over time about photography.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The 8mp is plenty for blwoing up prints.If you plan on blowing them up over 16x20 then I could see where the quality of the picture would decline,SLIGHTLY.But for sizes up to that it is very detailed and crisp.The auto mode will most likely be the best place to start.The camera will adjust the settings according to what youre pointing at.Essentially a point and shoot camera,when in this mode.Then you have the other modes such as portraits,landscapes,macro,etc etc that are designed for their designated purposes.Very handy and a great learning tool for the more hands-on modes such as aperture(AV),shutter speed(TV),etc etc.The Program mode is where you can learn about exposure,the camera will evaluate,set the shutterspeed and aperture and you will be able to alter the exposure and flash output.Very very handy when learning.As for the AV,TV,M modes,those are the ultra self adjusting features,the possibilities are almost endless when you grasp these modes.The wide range of lenses you can buy,EF or EF-S,are a definate plus for this camera.From the ultra wide to the super zoom.Theyll work with this camera.Why people have opted to go for the XTi over the XT is personal preference.Remember it does not change the quality of the image taken.The colors and detail in the pictures from this camera are top notch,much like alot of Canon cameras.The weight of this camera is very comfortable,again something some people take into consideration when buying,personally it didnt have any bearing on my decision,but thought it should be mentioned.This is also a fantastic camera for portraits and landscapes.<br /><br />Final Words:<br /><br />This is a beautiful camera that produces beautiful captures.A must have for any beginner dslr'er out there.A great learning tool as well.I have graduated to from a 4mp pocket camera,to a 6mp dslr-like Powershot S3,and I am now at this camera.I have used this camera and have gained knowledge about photography from this camera.Ive heard,and will agree,that this is a great camera to eventually figure out what kind of photography you want to do,whether it be weddings,landscapes,portraits or fast action,high speed.I have discovered that I want to venture into fast action,such as sports.Therefore this camera wouldnt be the top choice,that would be the 1D Mark II N.But again,I feel this camera has taught me enough about different styles and purposes of the camera bodies out there,which has in turned guided me to which style I want to pursue.And if youre wondering why I didnt opt for the XTi,its wasnt because it was higher it was because I felt this would be able to teach me the basics of the technical side to photography.Im not one to buy into the whole more mega pixel always means better pictures.Under most circumstance it really is irrelevant and if I were to present to you well taken photos from the XTi(10mp) and the XT(8mp),Im safe in saying I would bet that you couldnt tell the difference.It comes down to the photographer that decides what a photo will look like.Every camera can take poor,bad quality pictures if the person behind the viewfinder isnt well edjucated about the technical side of photography.Thus why I think this camera is a tool used for that purpose,to edjucate.If you get this camera you wont be sorry,a very very nice camera.If you are more concerned about looks and the feel of a camera than I suppose you can opt for the XTi,not a bad choice,very nice indeed,but not a large enough improvement for me to upgrade to it.<br /><br />So have fun with photography,it can get in your blood,and see you down the road."

I had tried some others, but I really liked, and still like, the way this camera feels. The image quality is excellent, the kit lens that comes with the camera is certainly better than most people lead you to believe, and the speed is fantastic, in both start up and burst.<br /><br />It's hard to say what the one best feature of this camera is because there really are more 'best' features than one. Like I said, I really like the weight and feel of the camera. I believe it's still the lightest digital SLR on the market. Some have complained that it's too small. I disagree. For me, this camera fits me very well.<br /><br />The start up speed is very good, if not excellent. Once I turn on the camera, it's ready to shoot long before I am. The battery life is phenomenal. While I haven't recorded exactly how many shots can be taken on a battery charge, I can say that it's hundreds. I personally have never run out of battery. Of course, I purchased a second battery for back up and simply cycle between them after each long shoot.<br /><br />The speed that the camera writes to CF is astonishing as well, as is the ability to take several pictures in a row. This comes in handy when shooting moving objects, as it's hard to get that 'one shot' that makes the day worthwhile. As I said before, the image quality is brilliant. I shoot in RAW+JPG mode, and doing so doesn't appreciably slow down the camera or the writing of the files to the CF card and the clarity and trueness of the image really is captured in RAW.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this camera. It is a steal at any advertised price."

I've used this camera and find that some of the shots I've taken were far better quality than I've been able to obtain with other digitals, The only exception is my 30 year old Canon SLR.  I like the quality, but find that the lenses will cost about the same as the camera.  Altogether this is a pretty good camera for the cost.  the weight is very light and with some care, this should last quite a few years.  This is good for an intermediate user who'd lilke to move from the traditional SLR to the digital. This camera has room for growth.<br /><br />I like it and would recommend it to friends."

I read everything I could about the various pro/consumer cameras out there; many articles supported the Rebel XT as a solid bet. I went back to what I knew from history - Canon. My new Rebel XT is - simply put - Fantastic! Great quality/performance to price ratio. Very foregiving for amateurs like me.

As my first DSLR, I was slightly intimidated by learning all the manual features, but the XT is very easy to learn, and I find myself never ever using the auto modes. My pictures almost always turn out perfect, and if they don't it's my fault due to still learning. I was also a little worried about the reviews that say so much has to be done in photo editing, but I don't find this to be the case. I spend only minutes on some pictures, and others I don't have to change anything, save for erasing some dust spots.<br /><br />My only complaints are these; The view finder is very small... Being near-sighted, it makes it a very slow process for me at times to do manual focus, though I do it anyway. However after a day of shooting I find my eyes hurting from the strain. This is where the 20D or 30D win. I played with a 20D at the camera shop, and was so happy that it only took me a split second to do manual focus with it.<br />And then there is the small LCD screen. I thought I lived with it on my point and shoot, I can live with it here, however I can't. It makes it very hard to make sure your shot turned out as sharp as you were going for with such a small LCD, or it may just be my eyes. This is where the 30D wins. (if you can't tell, I just ordered a 30D, though I will still use my XT as often as I use my 30D)<br /><br />Here is a tip that many have handed out. Skip the Kit lens. I bought it thinking 'Well, they might not use it, but I will' .. I used it maybe once at the most. Save your money there, and put it towards better glass. A great starter, if the 18-55mm range appeals to you is the 17-85mm f/4-5.6 USM w/IS."

They are finally replacing my 20d with the new 30d - but that's another story.  As an aside, I don't believe the problem was with the 20d as much as it was the company that Best Buy contracted with to do the repairs.<br /><br />Anyways, on to the review.  I gave a rating of 4 stars because it is a good camera in its own right. But after owning a 20d for almost two years, I was much, much happier with the 20d than with the Rebel XT.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong, the XT is still a very good camera for the money.  The picture quality is superb, with crystal clear pictures.  I did notice a difference in color rendering with the XT, but a lot of that could have been my lack of experience with the XT as the the controls are somewhat different than on the 20d.<br /><br />Another major difference between the two cameras is size.  If you have large hands, you will definitely appreciate the larger 20d.  The XT is much smaller and feels more like a toy in my hands.  Its plastic body (as opposed to the magnesium alloy body of the 20d and 30d) made me a little nervous as well.  Although I've never dropped my camera (knock on wood), I think the added ruggedness of the magnesium body adds a bit of insurance to your investment.<br /><br />One other major difference is the focusing.  I noticed that the XT doesn't auto focus nearly as well as the 20d.  It tended to focus on the wrong point more often than I would have liked.<br /><br />All in all, the XT is a very good camera and is a smart purchase if your budget pushes the 20d or 30d out of reach.  However, if you can afford to spend the extra money, I think the added features are definitely worth it."
Canon,Canon Rebel XT DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Silver) (OLD MODEL),20060723,B0007QKMQY,5,49,50,"on July 23, 2006",ANONYMOUS,Great Digital SLR,"I've been using the Rebel XT for over 6 months, taken literally 1000's of pictures and it's been great. Loved my old manual 35mm Nikon SLR, have been using digital point-n-clicks but wanted the control of an SLR again--no major complaints with the Rebel XT. Overall: if you're shopping for a solid DSLR, I'd definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+ Fast. I had a miserable time capturing action with my Canon S50 (a digital point-n-click)--response time made for hit-or-miss photos. The XT takes something like 3+ shots/second, a feature I've been happily using for action sequences I could never pull off before.<br /><br />+ Great depth of field. This was something I really missed from the old SLRs--you just don't get much depth with point-n-clicks even in those portait modes. The XT is great for isolating subjects in the shot.<br /><br />+ Battery lasts far longer than any other digital cameras I've had (I suspect b/c it lacks the preview window). As a bonus, the XT uses the same form factor as my Canon S50 so I only need one charger when I travel.<br /><br />+ Auto-focus is v. fast. I know I mentioned speed before but it's worth mentioning again. I hate waiting for other digital cameras to analyze a scene and take a shot--no delays with the XT.<br /><br />+ Starts up instantly. I didn't think I'd care about this but it's been great--you see a shot, you flick it on and before you can even raise the camera to your eye, it's ready to fire away.<br /><br />+ Software is better than I expected--it's actually usable as compared to some other software I've received with other cameras like Kodak.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The kit lens isn't terrible but isn't great. The manual focus ring is narrow and oddly positioned right at the tip of the lens; and you have to turn-off autofocus to use it (unlike most Canon lenses you can buy). It's also noisy. Aesthetics aside, the optics are ok and the range (from wide-angle to zoom) is hard to find in other Canon lenses (I've found that I've needed separate lenses to get the same wide-angle to zoom range).<br /><br />- One thing I didn't fully realize when I purchased was the impact of the 1.6 cropping factor of the EF-S lens form factor. The XT can take both EF-S and EF lenses. If you throw on an EF lens (the majority of Canon EOS lenses and what I've purchased for my zoom and primes), the scene is magnified by 1.6 (or you could say the edges are cropped). As I understand it, it allows for a smaller camera. The problem is that you really can't use an EF wide-angle lens since it loses it's wide-angle--you'll need to buy an EF-S wide-angle lens and there aren't many choices (I have the 10mm-22m). My concern is that I'm not sure whether Canon will support the EF-S form factor long-term and I hate investing in lenses only to have them obsolete in a year. Will see what happens. Something to consider since you'll probably be purchasing lenses to go with this camera.<br /><br />- Get ready to clean the camera more. I'm admittedly rough on my equipment (used the XT in the desert and the jungle). Problem is whereas point-n-clicks are sealed and the old 35mm SLRs would simply capture dust/dirt on single frame, getting a speck on the sensor on the XT (and probably most DSLRs) causes a blob on every shot you take until you notice it during reviews and clean it. I use a hand air pump--takes seconds but just be prepared.<br /><br />- One final note: be wary of suntan lotion and other lotions when using Canon cameras--I've managed to rub off the decals from two camera bodies so far--the ink or whatever is used to print the icons simply disolves.<br /><br />I consider these minor issues given the purpose of the camera is to help you take great shots and the Rebel XT definitely does this."

The light weight of this camera is a must when ounces count, however, quality is in no way sacrificed for this featherlight DSLR.<br /><br />My only gripe would be with the relatively small LCD screen size.  To add balance to the world, you are able to zoom in a great deal to pick up those subtle little naunces that could turn your photo-fresco into a photo-fiasco.<br /><br />Overall, this is one DSLR that is a must have.

Not that the camera doesn't work but it is hard to see the buttons on the camera. I mean pushing the button too take a picture is easy, no doubt but as an example i was trying to take pictures on the 4th. of July at night of fire works at the Columbus, Indiana campus of Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana and I couldn't see the buttons on my camera to change my manual settings. The screen on the back of the camera was well illuminated but the support buttons were not visible at all. While fireworks were blazing i was trying 'fumbling' to changer my shutter speed and ISO. What canon needs to do to improve this is illuminate all of the buttons on the rebel xt and all of it's cameras so all of the buttons can be seen at night. It would also be handy to have a on/off switch for these lights for battery conservation when they are not needed. but make the conservation of light button big and easy to use. aside from the night lighting it is an excellent camera and i would highly recommend it."

From other reviews, I thought the camera would be quite small, however it's a pretty good size. I do agree with others that the size is more suited for smaller hands.<br /><br />The shutter noise was also much louder than I expected, so I won't be taking any photos in quiet, public settings (the reason I gave 4/5 stars). However, the quality of the photos you get is excellent. I chose to get  the EF-S 17-85mm f/4.5-5.6 IS USM and theEF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 IS USM lenses.

The battery: The life has been phenomenal so far - I don't think that I've seen the meter drop below 'full,' while taking photographs, and that's at taking over 400 photos at a time (not all at once though, of course). Plus, it's rechargeable - Kudos to Canon for their forward thinking<br />4. Speed, Speed, Speed. The camera acts just like a 35mm which means that it has a pretty fast processor.<br />5. Cost - a very economical choice considering what you have in this camera.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />1. Expect it to be heavy, because it is.<br />2. There's no built in memory. So buy a compact flash card when you buy this camera as you will need it.<br />3.

This was my first true SLR, and I've taken it many places and taken many pictures with it while learning how to really take pictures versus just pointing and shooting. I will admit that I haven't become familiar shooting with any other SLRs and I don't have much to compare it to, but with that in mind, it's a great camera. If you are looking to become more serious about your photography and want to concentrate on shutter speed, aperture, manual mode, anything besides switching it to auto and shooting away then this is perfect (although you can still put it in auto.) You can swap out the lenses, and it has many shooting modes and options. It's an older camera, and my smart phone has more megapixels than this camera. That being said, this camera still has a good processor and all of the other internal parts to make these shots ten times better than anything that would come from even the best cell phone. The only reason I'm even considering upgrading to the T3 is because the xT does not have live view, has a smaller display, uses a CF card, doesn't shoot HD video and has less focus zones and less megapixels. The only reason I haven't switched is because the quality on this still very good and I haven't had any problems with this camera, so I can't justify spending the money right now. My recommendation? Some reasons to get this camera are if you have never owned an SLR before, if you're on a lower budget, you want a nice camera but know you'll never use it except for Christmas morning and whatever graduations and family barbecues you have each year, and/or you are a new photographer. Reasons you might not want to get this are if you can't live without live view (seeing what your camera sees on the screen almost like a video), if you have a need to take videos with your camera, and/or if you're you're not a beginner and you're willing to put a little more money into it. Great beginner's camera."

Small size. I'm [....] years old and it's still slighty 'too' small (although that is not a problem because I still have no problem gripping it).<br /><br />2. Great for every situation. In the month I've had it, I've done everything from ISO 1600 to ISO 100, used and not used flash, telephoto lens action shots at the race track, wide angle abstract stills, manual & autofocus and it has still exceeded all my expectations.<br /><br />*<br /><br />I'd say I only have 2 very, very minor complaints:<br /><br />1. Slightly heavy (especially with telephoto lens). Now this may not be a problem for adults, but given this is the 'kids' section I will say that it was a little heavy at first, but I got used to it in 2 or 3 days. If you absolutely can't stand slightly heavy cameras then you may want to settle for a point & shoot or a film SLR (my film SLR is slightly larger but definantly a lot more lightweight). Or you could get a tri-pod. Either way.<br /><br />2. The settings dial is a little TOO shiny. Yes, that doesn't sound like a problem and I didn't think it was either but a few days after recieving it I was out photographing in the backyard and the dial reflected the sunlight in a sort of intensified beam and shined directly into my eye (very bad eye pain for the next 20 minutes). My advice: Avoid looking at the settings dial directy on a sunny day.<br /><br />*<br /><br />Other than that, I would say if you're looking for a camera, I would very, very very higly recommend this one.<br /><br />WM"

For about one to two hundred dollars more, XTi offers some compelling benefits, such as:<br /><br />- New 3-point ultrasound dust removal system that cleans image sensor area; included software maps dust stuck in low pass area and electronically masks them.<br /><br />- 10.1 MP APS-C CMOS image sensor (3888 by 2592) vs. 8 MP (3456 by 2304) that improves resolution by 20% while maintaining dynamic range and noise level.<br /><br />- Faster image processing. In continuous shooting mode, it captures the same 3 frames per second but up to 27 JPEG or 10 RAW vs. 14 JPEG or 4 RAW.<br /><br />- Significantly improved 9-point TTL auto focus from EOS 30D vs. 7-point.<br /><br />- Brighter 2.5' 230,000 pixel LCD vs. 1.8' 115,000 pixel LCD.<br /><br />- Updated user interface.<br /><br />- Picture styles and RGB histogram.<br /><br />- More durable leathery paint finish.<br /><br />Of course, there are some losses, too. Most notably, XTi eschews dedicated LCD info display (integrated into main LCD now) and yields lower battery life (500 vs. 600 shots).<br /><br />All that worth extra dough? If all you want is to take great photos for less money, XT is still a great camera. I've used XT for almost a year now and it's capable of some amazing pictures, provided you use better than the crummy kit lens (although kit lens can be an affordable intro to the world of DSLR). If you can stretch your budget, XTi operates significantly faster with much nicer auto focus system. Higher resolution sensor, larger LCD with enhanced UI, and self image sensor cleaning system can be very beneficial to many as well."

There are poster-quality shots taken at the Butchart's Garden, Lake Louise, Lake Emerald and on top of the Banff overviewing Bow Valley.  This DSLR model is the least expensive currently only offered at Amazon, if you like to take your photography experience to another notch while not busting your pocket, this is it.  Since DSLR cameras depend primarily on the lens, you can always start off with the kit lens, and gradually migrate into other pro lens given your shooting habits.  Sure there are other newer models available from Canon as well, but $400 saved for an investment of a much better lens make this one a no-brainer.

The lenses available are awesome, and some aren't too outrageously priced.  I'd suggest the Canon 50mm f/1.8 of f/1.4, because with the kit lens you really won't be able to do much indoors.  The kit lens isn't the best, but is leaps and bounds better than even the best point-and-shoot (I have a Canon SD1000, and from what I've used/seen friends use/read about, I don't know how much better point-and-shoot cameras get)."

I was told by Canon that the card should only be put in until it meets resistance.  All memory cards will meet a certain amount of resistance when the prongs go in.

For a ten year old camera design this really holds up well and is more than adequate for 8 x 10 prints.  Out of the shipping box I was able to get some remarkably good shots such as the one I've added to this review.  Keep in mind that I've cropped out most of the image just to focus on one section in order to demonstrate the clarity and detail this ten year old camera technology is capable of producing with an inexpensive kit lens.<br /><br />I'm happy with my purchase and with the seller.

I was torn between Nikon and Cannon, but after doing A LOT of comparing and price checking, Cannon seems to offer the same quality of camera as Nikon with their lower end products and less of a cost. So far with my obsession of taking pictures of my adorable, yet fast moving, three year old, I am VERY satisfied with the pictures that it produced not only with stills, but action shots. (I even got some of him falling off his bike that are to die for!) My main concern with wanting a DSLR was to capture action shots because phone camera's just cant compete with it.

Though Canon has rapidly expanded its entry-level EOS line, this is still a great camera to seek out as its price is falling pretty rapidly.<br /><br />The obvious downside to buying this camera is that its screen is much smaller than just about any LCD screen currently on the market.  Its a good screen, though, and be sure to check your histograms regardless of camera.<br /><br />8MP is a fine pixel count, there is more to a good picture than the the number of pixels on the sensor, and if you shoot in raw you will be able to get decent sized prints, if you print at all (I rarely do).  Even the 'large JPEG' mode is great for smaller prints like 4x6/5x7 prints.<br /><br />What this camera's low price allows you to do is spend more money to get the good lenses and other equipment that you will use well beyond the life of one camera (hopefully).  Yes, the APS-C sized sensor creates that 'crop factor' but it is workable and there is a wide range of compatible lenses designed for Canon's EOS line.  In addition, I would recommend picking up the 430EX flash, as your indoor photography will greatly improve with something better than the pop-up flash.<br /><br />I have been very satisfied with the results and it is a great way to get started in DSLR photography, which is a different experience from point and shoot cameras.  If you are unsure about what your shooting demands are, or whether you even want to pursue photography more as a hobby, the Rebel XT is great camera."

I must this camera is amazing. I still have yet to master or even start to use 80% of its features. This camera is great for a beginner or really anyone who wants a wonderful yet reasonably priced camera.<br /><br />But you might just want to spring for a black one. I am not to crazy about the silver. But hey I am not looking a gift horse in the mouth.<br /><br />*UPDATE* After having used it for almost a year I am in LOVE with it!!! It works wonderfully well!!!! No complaints at ALL!!!! To sumrraize you cant go wrong with it!!!!

The images are great up to ISO 400 and very good at 800 and 1600. For the price it's hard to beat, but I'd probably recommend going for a newer camera with the ISO displayed in the viewfinder and a better auto focus system. Also, the included lens is so-so. I use a Sigma 17-70 which is excellent. The 3fps it captures is not quite fast enough for sports, but fine for kids. The grip is a bit small, and the camera can be hard to hold if you have a flash, large lens, and large hands."

A year ago I could have recommended this camera, but it's already succeeded by the Rebel XTi. Not only that, If dust were to get into your camera, you are doomed, as the XTi has a self cleaning sensor unit that shakes off dust. Any dust that adhered to the sensor can be removed with the bundled software. It also has a higher resolution sensor, although there is no real difference. In fact, the XT may have better pixel detail than the XTi. But if you want to look for a new DSLR, try a 10 MP XTi, Sony a100, or Nikon D80. Many critics would choose the Nikon, but I would choose Canon's XTi. There is only 7-point  AF, while the XTi has 9-point AF. I don't really care if you can shoot 3  FPS on both cameras or even 5 FPS like the 30D because you can't get light into the camera and it only works under super bright conditions. The only good thing is the price, which is cheaper than the XTi, but still not worth it.<br /><br />Quality: 2/10 (1/5)<br /><br />Lower resolution than XTi. If dust gets into the camera, your doomed.<br /><br />Value: 4/10 (2/5)<br /><br />Few hundred dollars cheaper than XTi, but still no worth it. More like a 'Rip-off' XT than a Rebel XT.<br /><br />Overall: 2/10 (1/5)<br /><br />Absolutely horrible camera, as it has been succeeded by a better one. Canon should have called it the Digital 'RIP-OFF' XT than the Digital Rebel XT, creating a new series!"

At 8MP it is all the serious amateur will need for good prints up to 11x14. It is very user-friendly and I judge user-friendly by how often I have to refer to the manual. All controls are easily accessible so it is easy to switch from 100 to 400 ISO or from flash to no flash or from aperature priority to speed priority. Also, there is vely little delay between shots. My only quarrel with this camera is that the resolution choices do not go low enough. If you know you want to use photos on the Internet, you don't need more than 200 KB; larger resolution settings use up memory space both on the memory card and on the computer and are slow to send with e-mail. But this is a minor complaint. I love the camera"

The build quality, features, and photo quality have made this camera a joy to own and use.<br /><br />When I first decided to move from film to digital, I began the long and tedious process of researching all the cameras on the market at the time. I had previously owned many Canon film cameras and compact digital cameras, so they were of course my first choice. I looked at Nikon, Olympus, Canon, and Konica(now Sony) dSLR's.<br /><br />The Canon came out on top in all catergories with the exception of a few at the time, such as price because of the Nikon D50, though the Rebel's other features clearly outway the Nikon. Overall, the Canon is just a superior camera, so hopefully, that saves you the trouble of spending nearly a month researching.<br /><br />Alright, so how is that camera? It is wonderful. It fits well in my hands and everything is where it should be. It does feel a little light, but it is made to be compact and light, plus that can easily be remidied by adding a battery grip. All of it's settings and features are virtually identical to the more expensive 20D, as is the image quality. There is a good amount of grain at ISO 1600, which is really a shame, but that can generally be fixed in an image editing program or by using a flash. The battery life is very good, but I do reccomend purchasing that battery grip that I mentioned before. Not only does it add weight and balance the camera, but it also doubles the battery life, which is good for those of us who go out and take thousands of pictures.<br /><br />This is just a wonderful camera for the prosumer crowd, and there is no reason that it cannot be used as a pro camera for creating prints and such. I would recomend this to anyone looking to break into photography or someone who has been photographing for 30 years.<br /><br />My recomendations:<br />- Get a few extra batteries and a battery grip. Remember, you don't have to buy a Canon grip or batteries, and if you don't, you'll probably save at least 50%. Do some research on here. The Opteka grip is great, it is what I own, and you can find a huge number of batteries, just pick own with a good review.<br />- Sigma lenses are generally in expensive, take great shots, and are durable. Some Canon lenses will have better optics, but will cost at least twice as much.<br />- Get the Canon 50mm f/1.8. It is a very inexpensive lens(about $60 - $70) and takes amazing shots.<br />- Big memory cards are amazing. Buy one, seriously. I have a 6GB card and shoot in RAW, so I get about 650 pictures. JPG will get 2000. I need another one because I shoot so much.<br />- External hard drives are a must for all those big files. I have a 250GB Phantom Drive, and I reccomend that, but there are now many cheaper alternatives.<br />- Don't forget a tripod and/or a monopod, a flash(though it does have one, external flashes are much better), and filters if you want to experiment.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy your camera as much as I have!"

You would think that for 600.00 they would throw one in for you?<br /><br />To make matters worse it's not clearly or obviously noted on Amazon or in the Canon description that a CF Card is or is not included with this camera.

I can say that it definitely exceeded my expectations. My husband and I had an HP digital camera before and I wanted to go to a higher level. It was worth the investment. It is so much fun to use this camera. The pictures are great quality and I haven't even used the highest pixel level for my picture. Also, I have not even played with all the various features it offers. The battery is great. I bought a second one to be able to exchange, but one battery is good for about two days and hundreds of pictures on a lower level of pixels. The camera comes without a memory card and I have bought a 4 GB SanDisc compact flesh card which has two sections of 2 GB each that you can use. I never take the card out of the camera, since it is so easy to download picture via the cord to your PC. I love the camera and can recommend it strongly."

The Rebel XT allows me to work in my 'dumb' mode, taking over most of the work when I am too busy to fiddle with settings. It also allows me to be wonderfully creative with its Aperture and Time priority modes. my favorites pre-setting allows me to use the flash, but keep then shutter open to allow backgrounds to show up more realistically. Great when snapping pix of the marching band at a football game or a downtown night scene.<br /><br />The camera's zoom setting lets me get closeup into photos I have shot. And a camera-to-TV cable that lets me shows pics immediately. The Rebel XT is very intuitive with features that I plan to grow into. It's a terrific camera all around that lets me focus on composition, especially at family events when it's about the celebration -- not the camera!<br /><br />I love it!"

Who is thinking of buying his next camera.<br /><br />2. Have never used SLR before.<br /><br />3. Wonder if it is really worth it to spend extra for Rebel, instead of a good point-n-shoot from Canon (for half the price?).<br /><br />Well, Yes it is worth it, even the complete automatic mode is much better than best in the class point and shoot. And as you try other semi-automatic modes (like sports, night, portrait, closeup), you will realize it was all worth it.<br /><br />I have recently promoted myself to using Av/Tv mode and took picture at very less light, without flash. They look so natural compared to generic point and shoot."
