It's a bit bulky, but that's to be expected with a built in printer. The pictures are pretty good, but not photography quality. The camera itself doesn't come with a lot of features as far as settings are concerned. It's all auto, so you can't focus the camera manually or anything. For the price point, I would expect some more settings. It's also 10 megapixel. The photos come out decent, but again... for the price, I would expect it to be a bit better. You can insert a SD card and use it like a regular camera, or print out photos that are already on the card.<br /><br />The pictures that come from it are cute, and small. The replacement paper is a bit overpriced though. Roughly coming to about 50 cents a photo. The camera doesn't feel very solid in my hands, very lightweight actually... but feels like a toy.

Polaroid,Polaroid Z2300 10MP Digital Instant Print Camera - Black,20150818,B008GVXKUW,4,1,1,"on August 18, 2015",ANONYMOUS,"Fun camera for teenagers, not for those who want high-quality pics...","I got this camera for my 13 year old daughter. She was very excited to get this, as she has never experienced a Polaroid camera before. Before she played with it; however, I took it for a test drive, so to speak, to see what it could do.<br /><br />This camera comes with many things which make it unique. The obvious difference between this and other digital cameras is that this camera can print pictures. Furthermore, the photo paper itself is unique, because it doesn't require any ink. Additionally, the charger for the camera comes with four different plug adapters, making it easy to take this camera on an international trip. Finally, the instruction booklet is printed in twelve different languages. I don't know how things are done internationally, but in the United States most instructions/signage, other than the stuff we buy at IKEA, are printed in English, Spanish, and maybe French. So, I thought that was really innovative thinking on the part of Polaroid, because it is able to create a product which is marketed with a more global appeal.<br /><br />The camera also comes with the standard products available with most point-and-shoots. It includes a wrist strap and a USB cable so that you can hook it up to your computer. It also comes with the &#34;Polaroid Z2300 Instant Print Digital Camera Software.&#34; Of course, as I already mentioned, the charger is included. So, you don't have to worry about batteries. As this is a camera which can print, they also provide a sample of the 2x3 Polaroid ZINK paper for the camera.<br /><br />So, now that I am done covering the basic information, here's what you really want to know. How does the camera compare to others? How well does this camera work? To test the camera, I had my daughter take four pictures of me: indoor with low-light and no flash, indoor with low-light and the flash, indoor with no light (completely dark room) and the flash, and outdoor before sunset with no flash. For a 10MP camera, all of the pictures seem a little grainy and soft. I don't really see any crisp photos. Honestly, the picture that I took of the camera and the components, which was taken with my HTC One M8 rear camera in low-indoor lighting, came out better than the photos snapped with the Polaroid. I did find that natural outdoor lighting seems to be better than indoor lighting. A lot of the pictures taken indoor were deleted, because they came out really blurry. However, I was impressed that the camera was able to capture as much detail as it did in a completely dark room.<br /><br />Unlike the old Polaroids, the digital Polaroid only prints the photos that you want to print. The printed pictures come out fairly close to the way the photos look on the computer screen, maybe a bit fuzzier/softer.The ZINK paper used for printing is said to be smudge-proof, water-resistant, and tear-resistant. I did try to tear the pictures. Let me tell you, these suckers are hard to tear. The paper backing on the photo did rip, but the top layer with the actual printed photo only wrinkled. Water is not absorbed into these pictures; it stays in droplets. While the drops can be shaken off the pictures without harming them, if you rub the water in hard enough (I had to rub it around quite a bit) it will smudge the ink some. So, the pictures aren't entirely smudge-proof, but you do have to really work to get the ink to move around on these. I did try to smudge the ink when I first printed the photos, but it didn't damage the prints at all. There was no ink transfer and I didn't have to wait for them to dry.<br /><br />Honestly, I would give this camera three stars. It's okay. Personally, I grew up with Polaroid cameras. I value the new technology and the crisp clear pictures. I have a printer to print photos up to 8.5&#34;x11&#34; and the photos print very nicely. My Canon 12MP point-and-shoot wasn't much more than this a few years ago and the pictures from that camera are so much clearer. So, I really can't say that I am impressed with this Polaroid camera. That being said, I didn't get this camera for me.  As I stated at the beginning of this review, I got this for my 13 year old daughter and she loves this camera. She never had a Polaroid and couldn't wait to get this and start taking pictures. According to her, this camera is &#34;four stars, because it's a Polaroid and it prints pictures very well. It's just cool, look at it.&#34; So, while I received this camera at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I am giving this camera four stars for my daughter. If you are looking for quality pictures from a point-and-shoot, this isn't the camera for you. However, if you are looking for a fun camera, maybe for your teenager, then this might be for you!"

For example, by having the digital screen, you can actually see and choose what you're going to print without wasting the &#34;film&#34;. It comes out finished, so no fanning and therefore running the ink along the bottom. The &#34;film&#34; or zink prints are far better priced than the old ink print rolls. Additionally, you can skip the film and upload the pictures to your computer to share them or print them at a regular size. It has lots of options that are aligned with current cameras like mode selection and editing. The detailed instructions are downloadable from a provided software disc or on the Polaroid site as the camera itself comes with a short start guide.<br /><br />So why 3 stars? Well, it's a neat idea, just like the old insta-print Polaroids were, but where they are currently priced, the novelty doesn't make up for what we've come to expect in a digital camera. For one, the boxy design reminds me of my very first digital camera. I realize that it has to be bigger to accommodate the printing feature, but it's not sleek or even attractive by any means. It is a box and not a small one at that. It would not feel so cumbersome with a better design. The second feature that I found disappointing is the digital display. This also reminded me of my first digital camera in that it's somewhat grainy. Not terribly so, but enough that it's noticeable and leaves you wondering about the clarity of the picture. Lastly, it comes with a 10 pack of picture prints to start. From what I have researched, you can purchase better or premium quality prints - the included sample pack is the most basic. That's good to know since the quality of these prints were the product's biggest downfall. It honestly looked just like an old Polaroid - complete with the fading and orange tint. For a 10 megapixel camera printing at a 2x3 size, that was surprising. Not the first example that you want with your new camera. So, I received this at a hugely discounted price in exchange for an honest review and while it's a fun gadget with the sticker prints, I just couldn't get over the thought that if I paid the asking price, even discounted as it is at $179, I would be disappointed."

So fun for printing novelty pics/stickers!,"For many of us geezers, old school Polaroid Cameras were the only way for INSTANT pictures...well as close to instant as it came!  Digital cameras and our phones have given us the convenience of taking pictures and then printing them when we get to a printer, but that &#34;in the moment&#34; shared paper copy novelty is still not there. The Polaroid Z2300 Instant Digital Camera is a fun blend of Digital Camera, so you can CHOOSE (and even edit a bit) the picture you want to print AND Printer!  As with the old school Polaroid Cameras, these prints are not mean to be high quality frame-able images, but rather novelty memories for you to share and maybe wear (since the prints are also stickers).<br /><br />The camera itself has a &#34;plastic&#34; feel that was disappointing at first.  I'm a little more open to it now because my teenager pointed out that Polaroid was probably going for a retro feel and look and she is probably right.  It certainly reminded me of the old Polaroid cameras and the big &#34;red&#34; button went from being more comical to nostalgic.<br /><br />Unfortunately my screen came with little scratches on it but I can't get a photo that shows the scratches really because they are so small and fine.  I chalked it up to the plastic construction.  It wasn't hard to load the photo film, it goes just behind the screen.  The batter and SD card load in the same spot on the bottom of the camera and I plan to add more photos and/or a video soon...(I prefer to use my Tablet and Amazon doesn't let us load videos from it yet)<br /><br />The print feature is what this camera is all about and I'm really impressed with it!  As I expected, the picture is about the size of a business card or wallet photo  and there is no ink required because of the special paper.  I expected it to print in about 15 seconds but it takes longer than that, about 30-35 seconds.  Printing does drain the battery fast so you'll need to be aware of that if you are printing mementos throughout the day.  I can definitely see this as a fun gift for a college student or teenager as the prints are cute and instant...I do like the capacity of 32 gb on a SD card if you choose to buy one (I think it's a must).<br /><br />The Good:<br />The quick business size picture (absolutely no fading and surprisingly clear pics)<br />  *Note: keep the mp size down on the pictures or you won't be able to print them<br />The size (I liked having a camera that was a little more substantial to hold)<br />Ease of use (took me a few minutes to figure out how to print and add borders but it is intuitive)<br />Being able to save to an SD card so you can transfer pics fast to computer<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The plastic quality<br />The weight (Because of the integrated printer, it feels a little heavier than you expect at first)<br />The battery life (when printing)<br />The digital zoom (makes for some blurry pics)<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's fun and my teen daughter loves it.  We love the idea of using them on each table at wedding receptions and having guests take pictures of themselves because they get the novelty printed picture and the bride & groom get SD cards full of fun candid shots of their guests.

I'm not normally a fan of Polaroid, coming from Canon DSLR land. This camera is quite nifty, in that it includes a printer onboard. The printed image size I'd say is about wallet size, which is great for on the go printing or if you want to give someone a printed picture right away. The camera is very well built, but I'd highly recommend against using it in low light."

My fianc&eacute; is a free lance photographer and it went with our photo theme wedding. In the mean time I’ve been using the Polaroid --- to take photos and to plan my wedding. Being that it is a destination wedding I have to basically preplan everything from photos and inspiration.<br /><br />It was very simple to use. Just put in a memory card and start snapping. I was able to preview the photos prior to printing. I have a wedding planning book where I print the pictures and include all the items I want to go in that area. It has visually been helping me plan without being there.<br />What you see in the screen will print a little darker but it gives it an old school feel. I love that you’re able to instantly create a vision. I have short term memory and this allows me to instantly capture the moment. It is very user friendly.<br /><br />If you’re looking for high resolutions you need just stick with a digital camera. Overall I think this is a great throw back to the old insta print camera.

The set-up was mostly intuitive, but I had to refer to the manual several times for the actual printing of the photos. It also felt more clunky than most cameras, which makes sense given its many functions. I am pleased to have gotten it to work, but as others have said, the photograph is tiny compared to others. If you are an impatient scrapbooker like me, this may be the answer to the occasional group photo, but certainly much more cumbersome for a day on the town.

They are different categories and totally unfair. FYI:- Its 10mp digital camera with actual instant print. -  with screen to view before you print (not just point and shoot) - builtin memory with the option to use external memory and price lower than $200. For me it has more value and much useful than fujifilm instax series.<br />pros:<br />- Good picture when considering the 10mp and the small digital camera sensor. for better photos use it in present of good light. most of digital camera in same category don't do will in low light.<br />- printing with this camera is great and fun and it prints 2x3&#34; full color images.<br />-  Although its slight big I prefer the shape and the size camera than the fujifilm one.<br />- For the people who asked if I can use the camera to print out photos from any memory card that already has photos. answer is yes. I insert my DSLR SD card and was able see view and print.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- SD card slot!! very hard for my big fingers to take card out. not sure why? specially if you use mini sd with adapter. minis sd will come out first when trying to remove it and very hard to take out adapter.<br />- I don't mind the physical button but I feel like the software is slight outdated and need improvement.<br /><br />In summery If I need digital camera with instant printing with the option to pick and chose my print and price less than $200 I will defiantly get this with no hesitation.<br />I received this product for discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

When I was a kid my dad had a big ole polaroid camera and photographed me and my family constantly and I always thought it was so amazing that a little picture just comes to life before your eyes. This camera is amazing its so small compared to old ones which is a huge upgrade and the fact that it doesn't use ink or cartridges is a HUGE plus! Who wouldn't be happy about that? Its a little dissapointing though that is only comes with 10 picture sheets, because that just doesn't seem like enough pages to really appreciate and figure the camera out. They aren't top notch quality photos but they are still pretty great. My niece loved having me take her picture and watching it come right from the screen to a picture she could really hold. And the sticky back was a very nice feature, I could stick them right on my fridge to display. The camera holds a nice charge I had the time to roam around aimlessly taking picture after picture all day when I first opened it and it managed to last almost the whole day. I wish the picture would print a little faster though that would be nice, but it probably wouldn't be as good of quality if of did. It wasn't the easiest camera to figure out but not as hard as my higher end ones. So all in all I loved this camera and lived how it took me back to old times.

Polaroid,Polaroid Z2300 10MP Digital Instant Print Camera - Black,20150822,B008GVXKUW,2,1,1,"on August 22, 2015",ANONYMOUS,"Stellar Idea, Poor Execution","I got this as a bit of a novelty, but had fairly high hopes. Mostly, those hopes were because of the specified 10 megapixel camera. Unfortunately, taking good photos is not this camera's forte'.  Here's what I'm guessing is the deal with this camera. Polaroid got a deal on some old camera tech, put the stuff in to a cheap, blocky, bulky box, added the printer, and called it a day.  Let me explain...<br /><br />The camera is huge and blocky and cheap-feeling.  It feels more like a child's toy.  The camera sensor and software seem like cheap, old knock-off camera pieces.  It feels like using a digital camera from 10 years ago.  It even uses old-school, big SD cards (not included) instead of microUSB and even the USB cable itself is the larger, older style, so your Android cables you have all over the house aren't going to help you out here.<br /><br />OK, so enough trashing of the tech.  Did it take decent photos?  Well..... not particularly.  There's no wide angle available, so it reminds me of my old 110 camera, where I had to back way up to get what I wanted in view.  Once you have that, there's no light-tap to focus, then shoot. Nope. It just shoots.  If you're inside, all bets are off, unless you use the flash.  Blurry is all you'll get.  Outside, during the day, it takes ok pictures. Inside, only with the flash.<br /><br />So what's actually good about the camera? The ZINK printer. That's what makes this camera worth owning.  The 2&#34; x 3&#34; ZINK photos are so much fun. You can print right from the camera in about 30 seconds. No developing time, like old timey Polaroid film. There's also no ink to buy. The ink is actually in the paper. SCIENCE!  So, all you have to buy is the ZINK paper. Good luck finding it in a pinch, though. I found some Target stores that had some tucked away. Stock up when you can.<br /><br />The printed photos are great. Use them for scrapbooking, journals, ID badges, whatever.  Great size to put up on your computer monitor at work or on the fridge. Great fun. The kids love it.<br /><br />Here's the straight scoop on this guy.  It's too expensive for what you get.  What I suggest, wholeheartedly, is getting the Polaroid Zip Instand Mobile Printer (ASIN # B00TE8XMMM).  I own that one, too, and it is aces.  Your cell phone will take way better photos than the Z2300B will and you can use Bluetooth to send them to the Zip printer. In fact, use anyone's cell phone and connect to it to print.  So, other than the novelty of having the printer inside the camera, I really can't recommend the Z2300B.  I wish I could, but I can't, honestly.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review, and that's exactly what I gave."
Polaroid,Polaroid Z2300 10MP Digital Instant Print Camera - Black,20150822,B008GVXKUW,4,0,0,"on August 22, 2015",ANONYMOUS,While not quite as fun as the old Polaroid cameras,"While not quite as fun as the old Polaroid cameras, this is a great option for those looking for instant photos. It is a little bulky compared to most cameras nowadays, but of course it needs to include the printer as well, so that's to be expected.  Unfortunately, that makes it a bit of a deal breaker for me.  It will be quite annoying to lug around most places -- but it's great for parties at home or other events where I won't need to carry it around in my bag all day.  If weight and size are an issue for you, this probably shouldn't be your first choice.  I would instead recommend getting the Polaroid printer which is smaller, lighter, and cuter.<br /><br />If the weight and size aren't an issue for you, I would definitely give this camera a shot. When I went to to take a picture on the phone, I was a little concerned at first.  The image didn't look too great-- worse than my phone, when it was up on the screen.  Once I printed the photo, however, it was much better than expected.  The actual printed image was quite clear and had great, vibrant colors.  It took a bit of work, but I was able to peel the back and use it as a sticker. I wouldn't recommend using the sticky back if you are concerned about bending the photo -- it was a bit challenging to peel the back, and I had to bend a corner a bit to get it to work.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this as a pretty decent option for those looking for instant photos. It doesn't produce professional grade photos, but I think for most people the results would be quite satisfying.  I just need to find somewhere to get paper refills at a discount (they're pretty pricey, and might make this less worth it if you have to pay full price...) and I'll use it a lot.

It is definitely only for journals or keeping a record. What it is perfect for is to get prints that we can hang on the fridge! This is too small for anything else. We used it during a small party at home and we exhausted 8/10 papers that it came with.

I wish I had waited,"Wait to get the upgrade. It will be half the price and much better. I wish I had waited. The camera screen gives you and idea of what it will take a photo of, but actually estimate for it to be off from what it shows. In addition to that, the camera crops off a small portion of two sides as shown on the print screen so you have to learn to estimate what you want to print on the Polaroid when taking the shot. It feels archaic and the photos look horrendous. I wish I had know about the new version before I wasted double the money on this one."

It does feel a bit like a wind&click disposable camera, but I'm fine with that.<br /><br />I played with the menu settings first to familiarize myself. It has LOTS! You can set different exposure rates as well as color filters, however, you can add MORE after you take a picture (in &#34;preview&#34; mode) and I LOVE that you tell it which ones to print, so it saves your film.<br /><br />When I tried loading my first pack of film, it would not spit out the cardboard backing. I tried numerous times, but evenually just took it out myself (it isn't actually attached to anything). I took a test photo specifically to make sure it worked properly... It did, but was a bit too &#34;vintage&#34; looking and blue-ish. I upped the exposure value to brighten it a bit, and added a &#34;vivid&#34; color setting..

The only thing I would say is that I almost wish there was no screen to see the pictures, although I know that is an odd comment considering we have this amazing technology. But for me, the magic of a polaroid camera is seeing how the picture turns out only once it prints and develops. Maybe I'm just old school like that, but I would rather have one of the older style cameras. If you dont care about those things though, this is great. It would be fun to take on a family trip so that you can just print the photos right away and save them for a scrapbook or album (otherwise, who really sits down and gets that done once their home... when you print on the spot it's much easier and youre sure to really get it done.)

If you ARE expecting that sort of camera, then you may want to stop and rethink your purchase. While this camera, in my opinion, shoots better photos than the Polaroids back in the day, it IS only 10MP, so it won't compare to my top of the line SLR. But here's the catch, I bought THIS camera with the intention of it being nostalgic and the fact that it's more compact, DIGITAL (never expected that 15 years ago!), and still prints instantly were just some added bonuses! I really like this camera for fun uses and plan on using it at events where my kids have class parties and such, and I just want an instant party favor for the kids.

First to set expectation right, if you're looking for a clear professional looking picture then this isn't the camera you're looking for (get a digital camera or a DSLR for that purpose). If you search for Polaroid photos you'll see that the photos have that oldish feel to it because that's what this camera is for. This camera is more like a hybrid of the good old Polaroid camera and the new digital cameras because just like the new digital cameras this is capable of storing pictures and it's great that you can only select the pictures that you want to print. Printing is quite fast, no staining and picture quality is good. The camera itself is light and feels more like a toy camera. It feels exactly like the old Polaroid camera but with the design and look of the new digital cameras.<br /><br />The only downside for me is I think the photo paper is quite expensive. I hope Polaroid will offer a cheaper version of the paper or some other company will produce compatible photo paper that are way cheaper.

I received the camera at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review, which (honestly) made it worthwhile. At my rate, I'd give it 4 stars. Because it's normally a few hundred dollars, I had to knock it down a peg. There is NO way I'd pay more than (maybe) $50 for this thing. That said, here's a breakdown:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-you can review photos before printing<br />-you can switch to macro for close-ups<br />-it has built-in storage and a spot for an extra memory card<br />-it's easy to use<br />-it's easy to set up<br />-it's cute<br />-it's cute<br />-it's cute<br /><br />Cons:<br />-it beeps loudly every time you press a button<br />-it's bulky and kind of heavy<br />-it has trouble focusing and exposing correctly<br />-the printed color is bad (and not like cool old Polaroid bad)<br /><br />In short, it's not worth $300. But it's cute. If you're going to spend that much money, you can probably get a real camera - I know I would."

It seems like the most complaints I've seen were from people who either think the camera is too big, or picture quality is not that great. I'm assuming these people have never had an actual Polaroid camera. If you compare this camera to the top cameras on the market today, of course you're going to set yourself up for disappointment.<br /><br />Now looking at the camera on a more realistic level of comparison, going from a very large and bulky analog polaroid camera with little to no control of how an image is going to turn out to this--it's quite the difference. This camera is about the nostalgia of a Polaroid exposure with slightly better picture quality and the luxury of choosing which photos you want to print. If you look at the camera from that perspective then you'll understand why I gave it such a great review. It's great for what it is. Don't expect it to be more than that!.

Well, I’d say the negative ones are mostly correct.<br /><br />Those that claim other reviewers don’t know how to use it must have terrible vision, never seen a clear picture before, or somehow received a different camera model than what I did.<br /><br />I own two DSLR cameras myself and almost exclusively shoot in manual, I know my way around a camera. This thing however, left me frustrated and disappointed.<br /><br />As many reviews state, it’s cheap feeling, bulky, and can’t focus to save its own life. I found myself taking the same picture many times over just to try and get a clear shot. When I did get an acceptable shot, it still looked like it was taken by a potato as compared to today’s cheapest of camera phones.<br /><br />I know what you are thinking, “that’s not what this camera is about!” I understand that this camera is mostly meant for fun and or novelty but what’s the fun when you can’t even see what you’re taking a picture of, especially at this price? On top of that, it has a user interface straight out of the early 2000’s point and shoot era. It’s terrible.<br /><br />When the lighting is right and it does take an acceptable picture, the printing function is actually pretty nifty. I love that the picture doesn’t have big white borders around it. The image fills the paper from edge to edge. It works great for relatively close up shots but if your subject is far away it’s hard to make out with such a low print resolution."

Here we go. I'm reviewing the red version. I don't like this camera and I don't think it's practical for any kind of moderate use, let alone every day use. First, you need to load the film paper in, there's 10 sheets per pack that fit in the camera, remember this. Second, it's a 10MP camera, which is perfectly fine for the camera it's in. However, they really skimped on the internal memory here, I was able to take 12 photos at 10MP before the camera was full. That's 32MB of internal storage they offer. 32MB. They had commercial 40MB hard drives back in the 1990's. It completely takes away from the functionality of the camera and makes it only usable to take a photo, print it and then delete it if you intend to keep using the camera. I don't like it and wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends or family."

Because I had a  difficult time finding a corner, that would allow me to peel of the screen saver film, I was ready to send it back. Then with persistence I was finally able to remove the thick protective film.<br />Had to install the software, from a cd, twice.  Rather a long process.  Have not explored all the options available with the software or the camera setting yet.  The user's manual, provided on the cd, is more extensive and easier to read than the one that came with the camera.<br />Printing is very easy and fast.

The instructions are super easy to understand and have set up and taking photos fast.<br /><br />The photo quality is perfectly fine for what I will use it for. Print quality is much better than old time Polaroids, and there is no waiting for the photo to appear, it's instant. I really like the fact that the Zink paper has an adhesive backing, which I would imagine could make this a great scrap booking accessory.<br /><br />The camera itself feels solidly built, it has a nice weight to it. It is also just so easy to use, it really is a turn it on and shoot type camera. There aren't many button to fiddle with and they are large and easy to operate. The screen is large, which I find a big perk.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great little camera that provides a ton of fun at parties and is an enormous hit with younger people.<br /><br />I received this item in exchange for my impartial opinion and honest review."

So fun for printing novelty pics/stickers!,"For many of us geezers, old school Polaroid Cameras were the only way for INSTANT pictures...well as close to instant as it came!  Digital cameras and our phones have given us the convenience of taking pictures and then printing them when we get to a printer, but that &#34;in the moment&#34; shared paper copy novelty is still not there. The Polaroid Z2300 Instant Digital Camera is a fun blend of Digital Camera, so you can CHOOSE (and even edit a bit) the picture you want to print AND Printer!  As with the old school Polaroid Cameras, these prints are not mean to be high quality frame-able images, but rather novelty memories for you to share and maybe wear (since the prints are also stickers).<br /><br />The camera itself has a &#34;plastic&#34; feel that was disappointing at first.  I'm a little more open to it now because my teenager pointed out that Polaroid was probably going for a retro feel and look and she is probably right.  It certainly reminded me of the old Polaroid cameras and the big &#34;red&#34; button went from being more comical to nostalgic.<br /><br />Unfortunately my screen came with little scratches on it but I can't get a photo that shows the scratches really because they are so small and fine.  I chalked it up to the plastic construction.  It wasn't hard to load the photo film, it goes just behind the screen.  The batter and SD card load in the same spot on the bottom of the camera and I plan to add more photos and/or a video soon...(I prefer to use my Tablet and Amazon doesn't let us load videos from it yet)<br /><br />The print feature is what this camera is all about and I'm really impressed with it!  As I expected, the picture is about the size of a business card or wallet photo  and there is no ink required because of the special paper.  I expected it to print in about 15 seconds but it takes longer than that, about 30-35 seconds.  Printing does drain the battery fast so you'll need to be aware of that if you are printing mementos throughout the day.  I can definitely see this as a fun gift for a college student or teenager as the prints are cute and instant...I do like the capacity of 32 gb on a SD card if you choose to buy one (I think it's a must).<br /><br />The Good:<br />The quick business size picture (absolutely no fading and surprisingly clear pics)<br />  *Note: keep the mp size down on the pictures or you won't be able to print them<br />The size (I liked having a camera that was a little more substantial to hold)<br />Ease of use (took me a few minutes to figure out how to print and add borders but it is intuitive)<br />Being able to save to an SD card so you can transfer pics fast to computer<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The plastic quality<br />The weight (Because of the integrated printer, it feels a little heavier than you expect at first)<br />The battery life (when printing)<br />The digital zoom (makes for some blurry pics)<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's fun and my teen daughter loves it.  We love the idea of using them on each table at wedding receptions and having guests take pictures of themselves because they get the novelty printed picture and the bride & groom get SD cards full of fun candid shots of their guests.  We have loved using the camera and have used it a lot more than we expected!  Our kids' birthday parties will be the next planned use because all of their playmates have LOVED getting quick little pictures to take home after play dates at the park and childrens' museum.<br /><br />We received this camera at a discount for our honest and unbiased review."

I'm not normally a fan of Polaroid, coming from Canon DSLR land. This camera is quite nifty, in that it includes a printer onboard.

My fianc&eacute; is a free lance photographer and it went with our photo theme wedding. In the mean time I’ve been using the Polaroid --- to take photos and to plan my wedding. Being that it is a destination wedding I have to basically preplan everything from photos and inspiration.<br /><br />It was very simple to use. Just put in a memory card and start snapping. I was able to preview the photos prior to printing. I have a wedding planning book where I print the pictures and include all the items I want to go in that area. It has visually been helping me plan without being there.<br />What you see in the screen will print a little darker but it gives it an old school feel. I love that you’re able to instantly create a vision. I have short term memory and this allows me to instantly capture the moment. It is very user friendly.<br /><br />If you’re looking for high resolutions you need just stick with a digital camera. Overall I think this is a great throw back to the old insta print camera. It allows you to take the pictures, edit, and add borders. I love it because its user friendly.

The set-up was mostly intuitive, but I had to refer to the manual several times for the actual printing of the photos. It also felt more clunky than most cameras, which makes sense given its many functions. I am pleased to have gotten it to work, but as others have said, the photograph is tiny compared to others. If you are an impatient scrapbooker like me, this may be the answer to the occasional group photo, but certainly much more cumbersome for a day on the town.

They are different categories and totally unfair. FYI:- Its 10mp digital camera with actual instant print. -  with screen to view before you print (not just point and shoot) - builtin memory with the option to use external memory and price lower than $200. For me it has more value and much useful than fujifilm instax series.<br />pros:<br />- Good picture when considering the 10mp and the small digital camera sensor. for better photos use it in present of good light. most of digital camera in same category don't do will in low light.<br />- printing with this camera is great and fun and it prints 2x3&#34; full color images.<br />-  Although its slight big I prefer the shape and the size camera than the fujifilm one.<br />- For the people who asked if I can use the camera to print out photos from any memory card that already has photos. answer is yes. I insert my DSLR SD card and was able see view and print.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- SD card slot!! very hard for my big fingers to take card out. not sure why? specially if you use mini sd with adapter. minis sd will come out first when trying to remove it and very hard to take out adapter.<br />- I don't mind the physical button but I feel like the software is slight outdated and need improvement.<br /><br />In summery If I need digital camera with instant printing with the option to pick and chose my print and price less than $200 I will defiantly get this with no hesitation.<br />I received this product for discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I think this is a great little product, but needs some improvements that could make it even better. As others have commented, it is a little bulky and the feel of the camera is not that great, but I can understand the weight as it has a small printer inside it. I love the feature that we can save pictures and preview it before we print it, unlike the old school Polaroids. This is really handy and if we do not capture the entire picture we intended to capture, we can always re take and print the picture we want.<br />One thing I must note is the size of the printed image. It is definitely only for journals or keeping a record. What it is perfect for is to get prints that we can hang on the fridge! This is too small for anything else. We used it during a small party at home and we exhausted 8/10 papers that it came with. The photo prints were great and all my friends took home 1 photo as a memento and it went straight to their fridge :D The additional paper it needs is not expensive but it is also not cheap: 50 sheets on Amazon is $34 bucks.<br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review and I can say that I am extremely happy with the camera itself and the functionality. I would like more additional sheets with the camera to coax the customer into buying this neat product. I think the exterior design and feel of the camera can also be made better. In short, tacky feel but a good camera with good quality photo prints!"

First things first it's VERY bulky, and made of cheap plastic, so obviously it won't fit in your pockets or camera case etc.  The photo printing which is the main feature of this camera is actually pretty good, and could print quality pictures, for a cost of about 50 cents per picture, so after using the 10 included sheets, you're left with a digital camera, that Is, if the camera was capable of taking decent pictures. The UI and buttons are clunky, and the camera quality itself is awful, it's advertised as 10 mp, but I wasn't able to get a single quality picture. The zoom is completely digital and only goes up to 2.4x.  My wife has an ancient Samsung phone, with a 5mp camera that can easily out shoot this. I really wanted this to work, but it doesn't, If Polaroid releases another upgraded version, I would love to try it, but I can't see myself keeping this one."

When I bought this camera, I read all the honest reviews about its poor image quality. However, I had great fun with it. I had enjoyed making picture stickers of my newborn. Now I used it as an alternative label printer. I am an toy collector and text-base lebal is not good enough for me. With this camera I can make picture stickers that shows the content of each sorting box, that experience was very satisfying and awesome.<br />I've read a handful of reviews on different sites and it seems like people either really love it, or really hate it. In my case, I really love it. It seems like the most complaints I've seen were from people who either think the camera is too big, or picture quality is not that great. I'm assuming these people have never had an actual Polaroid camera. If you compare this camera to the top cameras on the market today, of course you're going to set yourself up for disappointment.<br /><br />Now looking at the camera on a more realistic level of comparison, going from a very large and bulky analog polaroid camera with little to no control of how an image is going to turn out to this--it's quite the difference. This camera is about the nostalgia of a Polaroid exposure with slightly better picture quality and the luxury of choosing which photos you want to print. If you look at the camera from that perspective then you'll understand why I gave it such a great review. It's great for what it is. Don't expect it to be more than that. It's a great, thought out, fun product."

It's not only an instant printer but there is a spot for a SD card (not included) meaning every photo you take doesn't need to be printed immediately.

This comes with all sorts of different plugs so if you take this on trips to different countries, remember the plug attachment! Because there are so many plug attachments, this most likely will rattle when you first receive it, so don't panic (like I did). Setting up the camera is pretty easy. Once you charge it and turn it on, you select your language preference and set the date. The compartment for the paper is behind the screen.

This camera produces fairly small photos (2&#34; x 3&#34;) and while they don't have the familiar white border which I really like about Polaroid pics, the bonus is that the pictures have sticky backs. This could be really fun for kids and also useful for school projects. I think it could be great for any special event where having an instant photo from the event would be a special treat, like at weddings, birthday parties, etc.<br /><br />The camera is larger and heavier than I expected, but then when I think about the fact that it has the printer inside of it, it seems to be a reasonable size and weight. As a consumer, I have been trained to expect my electronics to be very compact.<br /><br />While the above may seem like negative reviews, my overall feeling is I like this camera. It is fun!

Purchasing this camera reminds me of my grandma, who every now and then just has to pull out her old Polaroid camera and will not upgrade to digital. I think it is awesome that you can select which images to print out, instead of every picture you take, it automatically prints out. In order to print, just push the double sqaure button and it will ask you if you want to print and how many copies. This camera comes with 10 photo sheets for you to load into the camera, which I found it VERY easy to do. All you need to do is open the door and place the sheets in the camera. It does need to eject the sheet card before you can print. When it comes to printing the photos, it does not really take long at all, but the pictures do come out tiny, I love it! I think it is such a fun way to take pictures and be able to carry them around with you in your wallet without having to fold the picture. In my opinion, the picture printed out pretty clear, I was actually kind of surprised on the quality.<br /><br />When it comes to the quality of the pictures overall, that is where I am not sure on this camera. The camera does take decent pictures, don't get me wrong. Just compared to my Nikon digital camera, the images are not as clear. I think for me, this would make a great vacation camera, when I do not want to chance my other camera getting damaged. Also, this one would be a lot easier to carry in a camera case or purse than my current one.<br /><br />Another plus that I like, you charge this camera with an AC adapter, no having to carry batteries around and hoping they are alive enough to last you until you are done using the camera. At the same time, just make sure you remember to plug the camera in the night before.<br /><br />I found viewing the photos to my laptop to be extremely easy to do. Just plug the camera in, go to the removable disc drive, select the folders, and my pictures were there. Of course, my computer gave me other options to view the pictures, but I found this the easiest for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this camera. While it could use a little better quality when taking photos, they do come out decent, you have a fun little printer at hand, and the camera seems to be made well.<br /><br />I received this camera at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion"

I was around 10 and the fact that you could have an instant photo was beyond my simple little mind, but I really enjoyed it. I didn't even realize that they made a more modern camera until I randomly found this clicking through my emails. Seriously? It was a must by that very instant, after I told the husband of course! Based on the color options and what I received I would state that the colors are pretty spot on to point and they all look so vibrant. It really was a hard pick.<br /><br />Based on the size of the printer within the camera it reminds me of the size of digital camera when they first came out. At least with this camera it's extremely understandable of why it's so bulky but not too bulky that it's hard to handle, whether taking pictures or printing. You have the basic options on this camera as you would with your standard digital camera. It's a 10 megapixel camera, which is actually a downgrade to most smartphones out - they're at 13 megapixels. Most digital cameras that you would find within this price range will vary from 16 to 20 megapixels. That's the only downfall that I could find but with all that it needs to do, it's understandable why it's a little behind with the megapixels.<br /><br />It comes with everything that you need to start up and use the camera and printer right away. Upon getting it you actually have charge within the camera to play around with it but I wouldn't recommend using it full blown until it has had a nice lengthy charge. (Wouldn't want it dying on you mid print. Yikes!) You can take your pictures as you would with any other digital camera and store it onto a memory card, which it does not come with, and/or take the pictures off your camera by plugging the camera into your computer, using the cord that it came with, and transfer them onto your computer - very easy to do.<br /><br />It comes with a pack of ZINK paper, 10 count. Make sure you keep the Smartsheet, that is on the bottom of the stack of picture paper, in the stack and place that on the bottom when loading your camera. You could take that paper out of the stack when loading the paper, it works either way. If you go to print a picture and you don't have paper in it, it will notify you but only after it acts like it has printed the picture -- so you'll have to sit through two 'prints' to get the one, but only you load the paper. When you go to print the picture you'll see a number dialog pop up so you can select how many copies that you want verse having to print them each individually. I didn't realize that and I started printing and I had it on 8 but was able to cancel after I ended up with two. So just an FYI there.<br /><br />You also get the adapter to plug the camera into the wall. The adapter you have 4 attachments to choose from for which one you're able to use. So if you were to take this out of country or buy it, being in another country, you can rest assure that you'll be able to plug up and charge your camera, regardless. It's a tad tough to get the attachment off but that's not the end of the world. Reason being is it's reassuring that it's just going going to fall off or get loose and not make a connection and once you get the one on that you'll need you won't have to take it off unless you were to change locations, as in countries.<br /><br />This is a great camera that will give you great prints in a 2x3' in about 30 seconds. The time in printing the picture will vary in the contents of the picture and what all needs to be placed onto the picture. Scrap booking, Christmas cards, random pictures to friends and family - you could use this camera and photos for anything and everything. Also, being that the picture is able to stick, by peeling off the backing of the photo, makes this that much more open for what to do with the pictures. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my unbiased review. My opinion was not influenced by the discount that I received."

I wasn't quite sure how it would work...would I need to replace ink cartridges? how will the picture &#34;develop&#34;? Would I be able to use it as a digital camera as well? What I found is that basically you get a 10MP camera with an on-board 2'x3' photo printer! The camera has all the features of a point and shoot digital camera...I haven't played around with it, but there is even image stabilization. You can zoom, you can record video at 720p, you can add an SD card to store your photos...but the fun part comes when you are able to instantly print out the pictures you like the best.<br /><br />The printer (right in the camera) prints out little 2&#34;x3&#34; photos (which can also become stickers if you peel off the backing. There is no ink...yes, inkless printing! There are fun little frames you can add to the photos too. I was pretty impressed with the speed and print quality. The camera is a little larger/bulkier than other point and shoot cameras, but it does have to hold the paper and all the printer mechanisms, so it makes sense. The display on the back is very large. The paper is a little pricey (you pay about .50 for a picture - buy it on Amazon in bulk), but considering you can CHOOSE which picture to print (which was never the case with the original Polaroid cameras), and there are not ink cartridges to replace, the price is pretty fair.<br /><br />If you want a fun camera that lets you print out cute pictures instantly, I would recommend this camera. It's not for those wanting professional type photographers. This would be an amazing thing to use at parties, weddings (guests take pics of themselves?), classrooms (pictures of the kiddos on mother day cards, etc), or even around the house - making chore charts or visual boards for kids.

There were more features for editing and taking pictures than I expected. But while the appearance and features of this camera are great, there are a few things that have room for improvement. The major problem I had is that it is designed so that the picture prints out of the right side, where you hold for the shutter. You have to switch hands or sit the camera down in order to not cause damage to the photo. It would have benefitted greatly from printing out the left where it had no real interference with hands. The second thing is that the pictures aren't good quality. It would be okay for scrapbooking or a child but even then it's a little steeply priced, in my opinion."

It has 10 megapixels and a 3 inch LCD screen. First you should charge the camera, there is a battery you need to insert into it then you can plug the camera in and charge. You also need to insert the paper with the blue sheet down. After the camera is charged you can take pictures, the camera has a small internal memory or you can insert a memory card. There is a cd to download software to your computer and a cord to plug the camera into a computer. To print a picture (2&#34;x3&#34;) you select picture and push printer button. The picture prints in seconds and is good quality for an ink less printer! Only downside I had for this camera is the size, its larger than I thought and not that convenient to carry around. It takes up a lot of space in my purse. But overall I would recommend! (I received this at a discount for my honest review)"

I just knew she would love it and boy was I right. There were so many cool features that makes it perfect for her such as the small size. You would expect the  camera to be somewhat bulky since it has a built in printer right, Wrong the camera is compact and great for easy portability. This is great for her because she can easily put it into her bookbag and take it with her. Because every teen has to be up with the latest technology, touchscreen has because an absolute must  this camera fits the bill for that as well. I like that unlike old school cameras she can take pictures and then choose what to print rather than wasting prints on a picture that isn't all that great. I didn't find too much that I didn't like in this camera. The major thing is picture quality isn't the absolute greatest but its not horrible either, it works great  for a teen who wants to print out pictures of her friends. Other than that the only problem I have found is not finding the paper around here in stores you can order it off of here  but it is quite affordable, so not a complete problem. Overall I am happy that she is so happy with her camera. I am happy to have gotten it at a discount to be able to try out and give an honest review on.

You can set different exposure rates as well as color filters, however, you can add MORE after you take a picture (in &#34;preview&#34; mode) and I LOVE that you tell it which ones to print, so it saves your film.<br /><br />When I tried loading my first pack of film, it would not spit out the cardboard backing.

The only thing I would say is that I almost wish there was no screen to see the pictures, although I know that is an odd comment considering we have this amazing technology.

Maybe I'm just old school like that, but I would rather have one of the older style cameras. If you dont care about those things though, this is great. It would be fun to take on a family trip so that you can just print the photos right away and save them for a scrapbook or album (otherwise, who really sits down and gets that done once their home... when you print on the spot it's much easier and youre sure to really get it done.)

You can put in an sd card and print pictures from it and store the pictures you take on it like a normal camera. The pictures that this camera takes are pretty good but not for you if you are looking for very high quality pictures.

My parents had a Polaroid camera when I was a kid that would develop the film instantly just like this one, but it was about 10x the size of this.  This camera definitely reminds me of those fond memories but in a much smaller and updated package.  It's great for producing small keepsakes on the spot that you can give to friends.

So, I was really excited to have the opportunity to plate with it!<br /><br />The camera itself is a bit larger than I expected. It reminds me of a small walkman... but I guess that makes sense since it has to have the whole printer in it too! It holds 10 pieces of photo paper at a time. The camera has a flash, tooks decent pictures, and is really easy to use.<br /><br />The printer functionality is also really easy. First, you get to choose which digital picture you want to print (so a step up from the old Polaroids where every picture printed out). Then, you wait about 30 seconds and you have the picture in hand. The pictures themselves are pretty small (2 inch by 3 inch), but they come out plenty clear. The colors are a little less vibrant than you'd expect... but it still looks really good!<br /><br />I think this would be a great camera for travel or scrapbooking. I plan to take it on trips with me so I can add a personal touch to postcards!"

And I don't have to worry about remembering how to access an obscure, infrequently-used function that my aging mind hasn't seen for over a year.<br /><br />The t1031 has a flaw, though. For some reason, Polaroid put an 'anti-shake' button next to the on/off button, making it easy to flip inadvertently. For this reason, it's a good idea to check the screen for the 'anti-shake' icon before depressing the shutter. But what's the purpose of such a switch in the first place? Why would anyone ever turn image stabilization off? If there is a reason for it--for performance purposes, for instance--this feature would be better implemented in a menu selection.<br /><br />Something to get used to: non-standard placement of the T/W button. Instead of left-right orientation, this one is up/down, with T(ele) on top. No big deal.<br /><br />A month before I got the Polaroid I bought my spouse a Sony camera for about 3 times what I paid for the Polaroid, partly because of how much Sony users tend to rave about them. The photos taken by the Polaroid are superior, with noticeably less noise; the Sony menu system is confusing and has resulted in lost shots; and I don't want to hear the words 'Memory Stick' ever again.<br /><br />About the only thing more I would want out of this camera is a larger zoom range, but you cannot realistically expect it for the price (yet). Today, if you're in the market for a camera of this type, and/or this is your price range, I'd get one of these without hesitation."

The pictures were brighter, sharper, colorful, the screen was GIGANTIC compared to mine. The function buttons were not sitting on top of one another and the share features were very easy to do. The video and sound was amazing, I swear you would have thought I had a camcorder. This camera saved my memories of her last year of H.S. becasue the KODAK was not even close to providing the same performance as the Polaroid T1031. Don't judge a camera by its price or color. :-)"

I had it for almost a month, but it never worked right. I used it only for snapshots and not movies. I took about 50 pictures. After this short period of time, the 'Replace Batteries' warning appeared; and I had to replace the batteries. Also, the camera was very hard to turn on. I had to press the 'On' button many, many, many times to get it to come on. And then, unless you kept taking one photo after another, it would shut itself off. Definitely do not recommend this camera. I returned it."

Once it arrived, I played with it for 10 minutes or so, and soon realized the problem that everyone else was having... it wouldn't turn on.  This particular camera I knew was a problem, because I never did end up getting it back on.  So I returned it and order another one (this time from a different seller hoping that things might be different).  It was no use.<br /><br />Once my second one arrived, it had the same issue, but was a tiny bit more reliable.  I could get it on if I played with it for a few minutes, pushing the button ever so carefully and differently.  Variety was no solution.  When I needed it, it was not available, so I called Polaroid.  Of course they wouldn't admit fault, but this is a bad model number.  So I returned my second one.<br /><br />In the end, after all this time had passed, the best value on the market (excluding this crappy camera) was a Kodak EasyShare C183 Black 14MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom for $59 at Walmart Online.  I went for it.  Not only does the 14MP camera work better, it has more features and is many, many times better overall.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Don't waste your time.  There were clearly some issues in production of this thing, because it is a magnificent camera aside from a very necessary element.  Avoid it at all costs."

I've made 9-10 shots and turned it off to remove SDHC card. Moved pics to computer, quality was decent, then I put card back in the camera and pushed power button. No response! At all! It's dead!!!<br />Do NOT buy this junk!!!<br /><br />Part 2. The next day experience.<br />I'm really confused. The next day I've decided to try my luck and pushed power button and the camera turned on. Since then it works just fine. I tried to reproduce the problem and here are my observation: Do not push ANY (I mean ANY) button while it is connected to the PC via USB cable. It went dead every time I did so. Actually 3 times, then I stopped to tempt my luck.<br />Other than that it works just nice and smoothly. No problem with turning it on/off. The picture quality is great, it's easy to operate and has got many, many settings to play with.<br />Overall, excellent family camera, especially considering the price.<br />Would I recommend it to anyone? Hmmmm, I guess so. But taking other reviews into consideration, it seems like some kind of gamble, though.<br /><br />p.s. Changing rating from 1 star to 4 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: After 6 months of heavy abuse from 12 years old kid the camera still works fine."

I had read the reviews posted prior to purchase and wanted a backup to my two smartphone cameras (IPhone and IPod) for use when traveling. I installed the batteries with the camera and began taking some test shots. No sooner than my 4th or 5th shot, the camera stopped working. After replacing the batteries and installing an SD card, I tried again and the camera worked perfectly. Clearly, any buyer should begin use with a memory card (of any capacity) to allow for adequate storage and with fresh batteries.<br />The test pictures were printed using your basic (CVS) service and even with enlargement, I was moderately impressed with the quality of the print.<br />So the two steps a new user should follow are:<br />  1. replace the batteries included with the camera with fresh high capacity batteries and<br />  2. use a memory card immediately before use."

There can be no question about that. After all that is what we want from a camera. The resolution is very good. Zoom is OK for a simple point and shoot. So I am completely satisfied with the quality of this inexpensive camera.<br />I bought it 'used' from Amazon so I won't complain that areas of the LCD are failing. The only negative comment I would make is that it is slow. From the time I press the button 3 seconds elapse before the picture is taken then the camera is exhausted and takes 5 seconds to recover. I know this is not so important when you compose the picture - but if you want spontaneity - very often the moment is gone.

Am I the only one who wants to take a video with this camera?<br /><br />So far the point-and-shoot is a little slow compared to other Canon cameras I have owned.  And for the record, Canon cameras have a dial on the top, so you just click over from camera to video.  Some even have a dedicated video button, so there is no switching at all.<br /><br />Polaroid customer service told me (after 30 minutes on hold) that no one had ever given negative feedback on the difficulty of getting to video mode.

I tend to by off brand with cameras, and though I've never had a problem with them, I decided to go with Polaroid this time based on price and the fact that they were Polaroid. I figured that as good as my cheap Norcent was, a dedicated camera brand with a lot of history would be even better.<br /><br />How wrong I was. It worked well for about a week; then it started giving me issues turning on. It was still turning on, I just had to hit the power button three or four times to do so.<br /><br />I figured the problem might be the batteries, so on the way to my son's first carnival, we stopped and picked up a set of batteries for it; a set of Energizers, and the ones specifically meant for electronics (also a brand I've used extensively, they work phenomenally).<br /><br />We got to the carnival and I was able to take two pictures. After that it refused to come on for the rest of the evening. I was really upset that it chose to stop working when it did; I had no ability to just go pick up an alternative where I was, and I shouldn't have had to.<br /><br />Over all the picture quality is really good, but there is something wrong mechanically with these cameras. Customer service was great and I had no problem at all returning it, though. I returned it a week ago, it got there yesterday, and my refund is in my account this morning. I'll probably be putting it toward another one of my faithful off brand cameras."

To add to the frustration is the lack of a good surface to grip while sliding the cover.  There are two raised bumps for this purpose but I feel they should have been beefed up for this purpose.

My favorite part, however, is the front facing screen, which is perfect for selcas, pictures with friends, and vlogging.<br /><br />The other reviewers are correct about the short battery life, but I simply purchased 4 batteries and a battery recharger, and those four batteries lasted me for about 6 hours of continuously filming and playing with the camera. Actually, the only problem with this camera that I've noticed so far is that, because this camera is great for outdoor activities, people tend to accidentally turn the video on and off when they, say, jump in the pool. So just be sure to keep your fingers away from the buttons!<br /><br />Also, as an earlier reviewer stated, -do- pay attention.

Not only did it take very decent photos, but we got the bonus of video as well.  Have to agree with other reviews - don't use the zoom feature.  The pictures get blurry quickly with zooming in on anything, but the wide angle shots were crisp and clear.  Took fun underwater shots as well, but only went a foot or two deep, so I can't speak to the tolerance of 3 meters as advertised.  Nearly all photos were taken outdoors and the lighting was great.  The few done with flash did require a long flash charge time.  Batteries wore down quickly - used 6 AAA batteries for roughly 200 photos and 15 minutes of video over 5 days - but still well worth the cost.  Tolerated water, mud and the general banging around of camping without any difficulty.

Some of the regular pics came out a bit shaky but other than that it was fine. It was small and fits in our little backpack shoulder pouch and the screen on the front was great for self pics (not always other people to take pics when you are climbing a volcano) I would definitely recommend this!<br /><br />and the price is perfect, all the other digital underwater cameras I looked at were around $200."

I bought it with the hope that if I got at least a couple decent shots of my family and I running the Dirty Dash 10K I would be happy.<br /><br />This little camera exceeded my expectations in almost every way.  I'll get the few downsides out of the way.  First, there is no way to focus on a specific feature in your shot.  It's just point and hope for the best.  IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO USE THE LITTLE LEVER ON THE SIDE OF THE CAMERA - THIS ADJUSTS THE FOCUS RANGE FROM NEAR TO FAR.  NOT USING THIS LEVER WILL GIVE YOU CONSISTENTLY BLURRY PHOTOS!  I was successful in setting it at long distance and leaving it.  I haven't used it for any close-up portrats yet.  Second, the battery life isn't good.  We cranked up the settings to get a full res, biggest size shots, didn't use the flash (it was a beautiful sunny day), and only got about 60 photos.  Switch to lithium batteries, rechargeables, or carry extras, because you'll need them!  The batteries lasted about 1/2 way through our 10K.<br /><br />Now, those 60 photos were pretty dang good.  Especially considering that camera had just been thrashed through 3 miles of mud, water, hay bales, and climbing walls!  When the lens wasn't mud-caked, the shots were clear and crisp.  I found the camera very easy to use.  I was able to hold it in one hand, point without really looking at the screen and snap a shot.  9 out of 10 times, the photo was perfect.<br /><br />This little camera survived quite the thrashing!  Submerged numerous times in mud and water, bashed around on rocks and walls, and kept on ticking right until the batteries died.  For the $70 I spent on it, I couldn't be happier for what I got!  4 out of 5 stars considering the quality, cost, and performance.  Overall I firmly feel I got more than my money's worth."

If you are looking for professional underwater photos, then this cheaper digital camera might not be what you are looking for-- BUT its perfect if you just want to document a fun vacation or water activity with pretty decent picture quality.<br /><br />I went paddle boarding with it for two hours and the instructor took about 75 photos of us and they all came out clear and really impressive, because I was expecting blurry/so-so photos. But, all the photos came out clear and even though the camera was submerged multiple times in the water, it continued to work (as it is supposed to).<br /><br />It takes a few seconds to turn on/off which is my only gripe with this camera, but honestly it's such an amazing camera for the value that doesn't even matter.

Wouldn't turn on.,"I bought this camera to take on a cruise to the Bahamas.  We were celebrating my niece's 19th bday and I had paid for her and my daughter to swim with the dolphins. I wanted a waterproof camera for our trip. I wasn't worried about submersing it. I just didn't want a camera that would get ruined if it got wet.  The camera NEVER MADE IT OFF THE SHIP.<br /><br />The BAD:<br />BATTERY LIFE: I read that the battery life is horrible for this camera, but the price was good, so I bought extra batteries. It definitely eats batteries. Even when you're turning it off between takes. It takes 2 AAA batteries, so buy a 10 pack.<br /><br />BATTERY DOOR. The battery door is terrible. Some waterproof cameras have 2 doors to the batteries (an inner and an outer.)  This one has ONE.  ONE very HARD to open door.<br /><br />IT BROKE. We took a few pictures on the cruise at dinner and of our cabin and towel animals.  After that, it never turned back on again. We tried multiple sets of batteries. NOTHING.  I had to use my cell phone to get pictures and video of the girls with the dolphins. I'm very disappointed in this. I'm an adult. A mom. The camera wasn't used in any rugged way whatsoever.  It simply went to dinner with us on a cruise ship. It was secure in a camera bag. We returned to the room and it would not work again.<br /><br />TIMING - It takes a while to take the picture. You hold the button down and wait.  Definitely would not be a good camera for action shots.<br /><br />NO MULTIPLE SHOTS OPTION - Because I also have smaller children, I like cameras that take multiple pictures (one right after the other). It helps to catch that 'perfect' picture.  This camera does not have that option and is blurry unless the objects are standing still.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />SELFIE MODE:  Like most cellphones, this camera has selfie mode.<br /><br />I am returning this camera and getting my money back."

I was looking for a waterproof camera for some snorkeling in the Bahamas.  Contrary to many of the reviews, I used this camera for days on a single pair of Lithium batteries, with battery life to spare.  I took over 200 shots in an hour underwater and didn't even see the battery indicator move.  The one downside of this camera is indeed the viewer brightness.  It is extremely difficult to see in sunlight.  And very difficult underwater.  But I was able to see enough that most of my shots captured what I was after.  I really did not have a problem with motion blurring either.  I only trashed a couple of shots out of the 200 because they were blurred.  I will continue to take this camera to the beach.  It's a great little second camera to have."

The image quality is barely adequate on photos and the video quality is a joke. I went through all the settings and tried several adjustments with no improvement. My old camera would take crystal clear pics and video even in fairly dim lighting, these pictures were either dim, fuzzy, or grainy. The flash takes way too long to power up.

I'm sorry, but we are not having any of the issues that everyone else is having.<br /><br />You CAN upload pictures from the camera. I think people freak out when they open the battery hatch, and the batteries fall out. It's OKAY! Just plug the USB cable to the computer and camera. The cable supplies the camera with power from the computer and it WILL turn on to transfer pictures. You have to press the power button on top of the camera to turn it on after plugging it in. It will not turn itself on. (We're using a HP desktop computer with Windows 7.) It would have been nice if the USB port on the camera was in a different location than the battery hatch. The Time/Date stamp will reset every time you open the battery hatch. I don't use that feature, so it doesn't matter to me either way...but it might matter to you.<br /><br />Some people complained that their pictures were blurry? Did you notice the protective film on the camera lense & pull the tab to remove it? After removing the film, did you check to make sure that the lense was clean? You would be surprised what a finger print can do to a photo. That is one downside to this camera...there is no cap, or little door to close to protect the lense.<br /><br />Moving on... In my experience, most cameras eat batteries. At least mine do. I switched to Lithium batteries. They cost a little more, but are worth the money. Lithium batteries last a lot longer than regular or industrial batteries. You can save power by turning OFF the front display when it isn't needed or wanted. We turned that feature off since we did not need it...no sense in wasting power.<br /><br />We took pictures indoors & outdoors...low light & bright light. Even when the camera was set down to 3MP, the pictures looked great. The camera is a little slow, but not too bad. We didn't try it out in water, so I can't comment on it being water proof.<br /><br />All in all, we thought that it was a great little camera and we had fun with it. We bought this one for our daughter, but I kind of regret not buying two of them."

The camera was fine, so I assume that the waterproof feature does work. The battery life is not that great, I went through about 6 to use the camera on and off for about 60 pics (3-4 hours).

The 2nd set lasted quite a while - several days of swimming and snorkeling in Hawaii and the batteries lasted for about 100 more photos without dying.<br /><br />The only real complaints I have:<br /><br />1. In daylight (not even particularly bright daylight) it is next to impossible to see the screen. This means you can't see what you are taking a photo of or what menu you might be on.<br />2. It is pretty slow. There seems to be a delay between pressing the button and it taking the picture.<br />3.

This is much smaller than the go pro yet had a nice broad view and a good photo/video quality.  I love that the cube is SO tiny and even has a magnet so that you can conveniently stick it anywhere for easy mounting.  I am looking forward to buying the accessories to make it waterproof for action video at the water parks, theme parks, and even just underwater at the pool.  I'd say the best quality about the camera is that it is so tiny that wearing it isn't even an issue.  It LITERALLY fits in the palm of your hand.  The accessories available for this camera help you mount it so that you can use it hands free for sports (biking, skiing, skydiving, etc).<br />While some reviews complain about the 6 pixels, honestly it is perfect for me because I don't print giant photos or canvases so 6mp is just fine.  I don't think most people realize that is the only time you will notice a difference, on a regular 5&#34;x7&#34; photo you can't even see a difference with the naked eye.  The 1080p video is great.  The battery life is great. Setup was totally easy.  I think it's a great little camera!  *I received a sample of this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review*"
Polaroid,Polaroid Cube HD 1080p Lifestyle Action Video Camera (Blue),20150817,B00NEZ6OW6,4,1,1,"on August 17, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Small But Mighty - and Mighty Fun!,"There's a lot to love about the POLC3 Cube - it's compact enough to fit in a pocket or purse, the rubber casing is cute and incredibly protective (which is great for tiny hands), and the video quality is excellent, as is the sound. I also really like how wide of a shot this tiny little camera can take - it's deceptively talented for it's small size and minimal interface! The two cat photos included were taken using the POLC3 in dark lighting, to give you an idea of the photo quality. There are a few things I wish I knew before buying, so let me share them with you:<br /><br />1. To insert the (required) micro SD card or to connect the POLC3 to your computer to charge, switch the pixel resolution of your videos (between 720 and 1040 pixels) or upload media, you need to unscrew the access port backing with a coin. This can be somewhat cumbersome, and the micro USB cable they include is seriously short - we're talking 3 inches at the longest. However, there are so many devices out there that use micro USB cables that it isn't hard to find a different cable to use.<br />2. While the camera does require a micro SD card to work, sandisk SD cards are incompatible - which can be a somewhat expensive piece of trial and error to find out on your own! Other class 10 micro SD cards (which must be 32 gb or smaller) such as Samsung, Lexmark, or Transcend work just fine, it's just curious to me that genuine SanDisk micro SD cards don't work. They should also specify this in the manual, which they do not.<br />3. The light for the user interface, which changes color to indicate if the camera is on, taking a photo, recording, or in need of charging is difficult to see in broad daylight outdoors - I recommend using the camera at dusk or later (the image quality is surprisingly good!) or indoors - but there are also specific beeping patterns the camera emits at the same time as changing the light display color, so even if you can't see the light you aren't left clueless. That's helpful!<br />4. The POLC3 Cube does not have a viewfinder, which is not necessarily a bad thing - I believe Polaroid is trying to recapture the spontaneous, joyous mystery of their original cameras with instantly developing film, and translating that excited anticipation to the modern age. But if you're used to taking photos with your smartphone, it's a change you should be ready for!<br />5. This version of the POLC3 Cube does NOT feature the new built-in wifi or app that synchronizes with your smartphone. I didn't find these items necessary to have all sorts of fun, but for pro photographers it could be a useful addition for the minimal added cost.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this little camera has to be the super-strong magnet on the bottom - this makes it easy to attach to all sorts of extensions, but also to regular metal objects like the top of a car or a metal fencepost. The portability and durability of this cutie are two of its biggest selling points - it would be great to hand over to a child, trusting that the water-resistance and soft, rounded rubber casing will protect both the camera and the kid from any damage! It's simple, fun, and incredibly intuitive. Just don't forget to buy a micro SD card (that isn't SanDisk!), so you can play with your new gizmo right out of the box. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, and I'm so happy that I got to try out the POLC3! I'm definitely a fan!"

You have to make a trip to the store to buy yourself a mircor sd card if you dont have one already, but its worth it if you want something compact to take pics or videos.

Inside the packaging was the cube, the USB cable, and a small manual. It does not come with the micro SD memory card, that will need to be purchased separately. Please note, it is weatherproof/splash proof but it is not water resistant. Just meaning in a light rain, it will be okay. But, you should not submerge it in water.That would be a bad idea. My main reason behind purchasing the cube was to place it on the dash of my car during local car shows. Inside the packaging there was a little metal plate to help hold the camera in place by it's magnet. This helps serve as a mount. Which is perfect for my use. It records in both 1080p and 720p. It honestly took me about a week or two to figure out how to use it, since you can't physically see what you are recording it, as you are recording it.

I decided to be a little risky and take it on a water ride with me. When I knew a big splash was coming our way on the ride, I covered the camera but water still did get on it and there was no damage! So the weatherproof did work for me in this case and I was very pleased about that!<br />  You can record video in 720 or 1080p. I always keep my settings on the 1080 and the quality is great! There was no lagging or a pixelated video. The camera also took impressive photos, however I didn't really use the photos option as much as I use this camera to record videos.

I like that it has a rubbery coating to make it easier to grip because it really is very small. The instructions were easy to follow and I was up and running in no time. Good fun and a quality product. I was able to try this one out for a discount in exchange for an honest review and I think it is a really good product.

I purchased the black one and it is an awesome rival to the other well-known action recording video cameras, but the value on this is great coming in at under $100 and recording in high-def, magnet mount, and ease of operation. This is the perfect size too for my 2 little kids who are all about selfies and pictures. With Christmas coming up, I may plan on getting a few more of these as gifts since they are small and easy for stocking stuffers.

Polaroid,Polaroid Cube HD 1080p Lifestyle Action Video Camera (Blue),20150820,B00NEZ6OW6,5,1,1,"on August 20, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Fun and Functional!,"This is a pretty neat little camera!  As the name implies, it's a cube, measuring about 1.5 inches on each side and encased in a hard double layer of rubber.  So when you drop this thing, don't worry, it's probably OK!  The camera features a wide 124 degree lens which gives that really cool POV effect when you mount this to something moving.  Speaking of mounting, the bottom side of the cube has a really strong little magnet and there's a bevy of mounting accessories you can buy to help you attach this thing to various places.  The magnet does work without any accessories if you just stick it on a metal surface, and it will hold pretty well!<br /><br />As for using the camera, first thing is to pop the plate off the back of the cube and insert a mini SD card.  There's no internal memory, so if you try to operate the camera without putting in a card, the little LED light will just flash red at you to let you know that you don't know what you're doing.  Below the card slot is a little switch where you can pick between 720p and 1080p, then below that is the spot where you insert the mini end of the USB cable.  The cable that comes with the camera is about 2 inches long, but it gets the job done.  To operate, the top face of the cube has a button and a little LED indicator light.  Hold the button down for a few seconds, and the unit will beep and a green light will come on.  Once you have a green light, a single push of the button will take a picture, and a double-click will begin a video recording (another click will end the recording).  Hold the button down again for a few seconds to power off.  Very intuitive to use, I actually just guessed that was how it would work, and sure enough I was right.  To view your pics and videos, just plug the cube into your computer and open it up like a storage device.  Photo and video quality are awesome, even in 720p.  The sound on the videos is perfectly clear, as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun but very functional little action camera!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
Polaroid,Polaroid Cube HD 1080p Lifestyle Action Video Camera (Blue),20150820,B00NEZ6OW6,3,2,2,"on August 20, 2015",ANONYMOUS,"Nice Idea, but Flawed","I was looking forward to trying this small cute camera, but after receiving the product, it was a bit more frustrating to use than I had originally thought.<br /><br />The camera is very small and a great size. It's very lightweight as well.<br /><br />The magnetic is strong enough to make the camera stay put if you place it on a metal surface, even a car, but it's not strong enough to pick up and hold the metal object. I tried picking up metal objects like batteries, a chip clip, a spring, etc. It would pick up the object, but after about 6 inches off the surface the object I picked up with the camera's magnet would drop.<br /><br />The back opening of the camera is about the size of a quarter or slightly smaller. I could only get it open with a coin. I tried opening it with other objects that would fit in the groove, but it wouldn't move. There's two groves slit into the sides of the back cover to open and close it. There's a little seal to help protect the inside of the camera from getting wet. It won't work if it's dunked in water, but it'll help reduce the chances of small splashes affecting the camera.<br /><br />Inside the back case, the charging port, micro sd card slot, and a tab to switch between 720 or 1080 resolution. The only issue I had with the items in the back case is the sd card slot. You place the sd card with the image down, so it's upside down, into the slot and push in. The problem comes when you try to get the sd card back out. Pressing it in further won't get it to pop out, and there's not enough space to grab a hold of the card and pull it out. I had to bang the back of the camera (thankfully I had a rubber case on the camera to help protect it) on a hard surface. The sd card would finally loosen enough that it can get pulled out. It's a massive pain.<br /><br />If you're lucky, you won't have to pull the micro sd card out. I'm not so lucky. My computer won't connect to the camera. No matter how many usb cords I've tried and which usb port I put it in. The camera will light up to show it's on or charging, but it won't connect. I have to pull the sd card out to get to view any images or videos I took.<br /><br />To take photos or images, there's only one power or shutter button. It's confusing at first to get it to work. By pressing and holding the button until the camera buzzes and the light on top turns green will turn on the camera. Press once and the light will turn red, which means it's taking a photo. Press the button twice and the light will be a flashing orange, which means it's taking a video. To turn on the camera, press and hold the button again until the lights turn off.<br /><br />A major downside is that the battery only last for 90 minutes. It's fine if you have a backup battery or external charger with you to charge it while you go, but otherwise, 90 minutes isn't that long of a time. There's also no way of seeing how fully charge the device is.<br /><br />If you're not in good lighting or outdoors when the sun is shining, the photos or videos don't come out looking like it's in high definition.<br /><br />Another downside to the camera I received, the mic doesn't seem to work on my videos when I play them back on the computer.<br /><br />I received this product through a promotion in exchange for a honest and unbiased review."

I was surprised by the actual size of the product but even more surprised at the quality of the videos and pictures.  It came boxed in a little plastic container complete with connection cable and charger. It took about 90 minutes to fully charge. You can change the pixel on your pictures based on the type of photos that you want to take. I recommend that you get a SD card with your purchase and a strap to hang around your neck or a mount. This will be a great gift for all ages. My daughter loves it. It has a magnetic base and you can change or access the charger by simply removing the base with a quarter.

Its small and easily portable for those &#34;Must catch on camera&#34; moments. The instructions are clear and concise as to what the lights and the beeps mean. Pretty simple, hold the button for a few seconds to turn it on, 1 press for picture, 2 presses to start recording.<br /><br />The only downfall of this camera was that it didnt come with a SD card for me to actually use the camera with. I had to order a 32g samsung SD card for it to work after reading further on the internet that theres some cards that just dont like to work with it for some reason. That being said, if youre buying this camera, make SURE that you get a CLASS 10 SD card for it for the best results.<br /><br />After recieving the SD card for it, i was able to actually test it out a bit. The 720 and 1080p pictures come out phenomenally. The 720p camera works flawlessly. I had minor trouble with getting the 1080p video to play on my computer but that could have been something on my end. The videos save in 5 minute file portions with a .MOV format(Quicktime). I was able to play them with sound on the VLC player but not on Windows Media Player which .MOV isnt entirely suited for.<br /><br />All in all, this camera is the beginning of a journey for my fiancee and I. We plan on using it to vlog and capture our adventures in the world. Really couldnt have asked for a better camera.<br /><br />Note: I recieved this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

He is always using his tablet to make these films and that just isn't practical. Number one because the quality of the camera on an ipad really doesn't carry for making films and I am always afraid he's going to drop and break it which would cost a few hundred dollars to replace. I was going to buy a gopro for him for Christmas but I was turned off at the price of them. When I saw this, it was exactly what I wanted for my child. The battery holds 90 minutes of charge so you have plenty of time to film everything you need and you don't have to replace batteries which will save you a ton of money. Its only one cubic inch around which is so convenient for when he wants to wear this around his neck or put it on a selfie stick. He's made some funny and action packed little videos because of this camera and the video quality is much much better than what he was capturing on his ipad. It's also a camera so all he has to do is do a single click. You can clip this on anything and films excellently. I am extremely happy with my purchase. Original bottles that came had leaks. The company went above and beyond to make it right. Would purchase again. I highly recommend buying from them. I received this product at a discount to get my honest and unbiased feedback from it.

The reason I won't buy a GoPro is that it's pricey for me. Although to be fair, the Polaroid POLC3 Cube does not belong to the same league as a GoPro and it does not do justice to this review of the Cube if I don't keep the size and price into consideration.

I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review and I tested the camera and it's features.

It does stay secure and I hope it does not pop out 2) The memory card is inserted with the contacts facing up which to me is non-standard.<br /><br />I should mention the the wide angle lens do cover a large area.

While it is not as swift or customizable as other brands, it definitely packs a lot of punch.<br /><br />Its small unique styles makes it fun, hip and retro!!  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because I was unaware that certain MicroSD cards wouldn't be compatible.  I first went with the one that is in my phone, which is a sandisk, the photos wouldn't take and videos weren't being recorded.  I did a chat with amazon and they quickly sent out a new one to be replaced but the same thing happened with the new one.  That's when I did some research online and saw that certain SD cards aren't compatible.  I ended up purchasing a Samsung 32GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDHC and it worked!!<br /><br />My initial photos aren't as clear as the ones on the polaroid website but I'm still learning the ins and outs.

It's tough, well manufactured and can take some exposure to the elements, so rain shouldn't be an issue.  If you want to submerge the camera, buy the waterproof case.

Great and tiny form factor with a few areas to improve. This definitely is not your most extreme action camera, but it doesnt hold the price tag for that either."

Sometimes when I want to record I guess I don’t press the buttons right and it won’t record.<br /><br />I mean yea it seems fairly simple but I guess I am one that is not so electronically inclined.<br /><br />I thought that I would be ok with not being able to see what I was recording but not so much. I will add if I do decide to get any of the attachments to make it like a dash cam or anything then this is great for that.<br /><br />I wish that you didn’t need an sd card for it because to me that just seems like a waste. I wish you could use it without an ad card.<br /><br />Overall this is a great item if you don’t mind not being able to see what you’re recording. If you are someone that does crazy stunts or goes on road trips, hiking through the mountains then yea this is the item for you. however if your wanting to use this as a regular old camera than I think you should think a little bit harder about this one.<br /><br />I did get this product with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest review.

I wanted something that was not to expensive but that I was still able to shoot good video on when I wanted and this camera has done the trick. It is very small which for me is not a problem, but others may want something bigger. It is pretty durable thus far, we have had out drops and tumbles and it has not affected the camera at all. You can buy different mounts for your needs that attach by using the magnetic base at the bottom. It takes some getting use to because you do not have a view finder to see what you are taking video or shots of. But the lens covers 124 degrees so it should catch what you need. In my experience it takes very nice video  and  still photos. The instructions that come with this camera are easy to read, and the camera is easy to use. The perfect camera for beginners or people that do not have very demanding needs when it comes to an action camera. ** I received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased review**"

I have had several tiny cameras over the years that shoot video and pictures, but none with this much clarity. I used it in my car to record while I was driving, and the video was crystal clear and includes audio. I recorded a woodworking project and sped it up just for fun, and again, it was crystal clear. The pictures it takes are obviously clear as well, and using freeware, I was even able to capture the screen from my video to make still shots. The magnet inside the camera is really strong - I wouldn't worry about it shaking loose unless you're racing motocross, and even then it'll probably hold. The only negatives I can think of are the need for a memory card, and the battery life. I didn't realize I needed a memory card, so I had to order one and wait before I could use the camera. I can take the blame for that, since I could have found that out with a little more diligence. The battery life is a little over an hour of recording, which in Polaroid's defense, is a ton of time considering the tiny size of this camera.The memory card is easy to insert and remove, and the camera is easily connected to a computer. I received a discount for my honest review of this camera, and I expected to get another so-so video camera. This is way better than all the other small cameras I've bought in the past, and the lack of moving parts makes this seem pretty rugged and durable."

The quality of the images, both video still are extremely clear and not pixelated.  I had some difficulty getting it to work, but, this was my fault for not reading the directions.  This camera can only take a micro SD card of 32 GB max.  I inserted a 64GB and it did not function.  It is listed clearly that the max size of the card is 32GB.  Once I placed the 32GB card in the slot, it was so easy to use.  To activate, all you have to do is hold down the multifuntion button on top.  It will beep 3 times and indicate that it is on.  To take still photos, depress the button once.  To take videos, depress the button twice.  It is as easy as that.<br /><br />There is built in software that can be installed onto your computer to manipulate the settings of the camera.  There is a strong magnet at the bottom of the camera so you can afix it to metal and have it stationary without a mount.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product and the compact nature and image quality make it a great asset for on the go pictures and video.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."

I've wanted a camera that could take quality videos of me swimming in order to assess my stroke and technique.  The GoPro, at one time, was a good option for the price.  Now that it's exploded in popularity, so has the price.  The solution?  The Polaroid Cube!<br /><br />This little guy is amazing.  I was floored when I saw how small it was.  The entire thing could fit inside a hollowed-out golf ball - it's THAT small.  It's also very light, and the case is made out of rubber so it has a great feel in the hands.  For some reason, I couldn't stop touching it when I first held it.<br /><br />Don't let the small package fool you, though.  This thing has a WIDE angle lens.  So much so that you might not want to get up close if you don't want your face distorted.  However, it truly excels in the long shots.  Taking the Cube outside, I found that views of the scenery are crisp and clean.  It doesn't quite capture everything in a 180 degree field, but it's pretty close (around 120 or so).  Audio is very good.  I don't think it would win any awards, but generally surround sound audio isn't what's important when you're looking at an action-based video camera.<br /><br />I purchased the&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/34-waterproof-case-34/dp/B00NXK3FZ6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>&#34;waterproof case&#34;</a>&nbsp;along with this camera.  This was a huge improvement for positioning the camera both in and out of the water.  It's also pretty much required if you're thinking about getting this near water.  Also be advised that you will absolutely need a micro SD card.  I purchased&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/34-this-one-34/dp/B00IVPU786/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>&#34;this one&#34;</a>&nbsp;and it works great.<br /><br />I haven't used the GoPro, so I can't truly comment on differences between the two.  This does not have wireless capability, and it can only store up to 32 GB on an SD card.  Further, larger filming times are split into segments when uploaded to your computer, so you have to stitch them together.  However, this is MUCH lower in cost.  If you're in to filming you and your friends in motion, this would be a great place to start.  However, if you're SERIOUS about such films, you'd probably want to consider the upgrade to the GoPro.<br /><br />As for me, I found that the Polaroid Cube was EXCELLENT for my needs.  I can assess my stroke underwater, the videos are crisp and clear without any distortion, and in fact the shorter clips are perfect for what I'm doing.  I honestly could not ask for more.<br /><br />This product was on my Amazon Wish List, but I received it at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.  I am THRILLED that I had a chance to finally play with it.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."

The cube has a magnet on the bottom of it so you can set it up on a metal surface to catch the action going on around. I used a metal pole we had to try it out , I suggest to buy the gear available for this to use it a lot better than I did, I was able to get the video to work  but no sound. I know this is a problem with my software not the cube did try it on a different computer and it works with ease. Quality of the video was amazing. Waterproofing is one of my favorite features so no worries about it getting damaged when using it pool side and the back of it where the micro SD card goes is very secure, you need a coin to open it so no losing anything(I use a quarter to do this).

The rubberized coating is a nice feel and the initial quality of both stills and video were quite impressive mostly due to the size of the product.  The computer interface was confusing at first but with a little online research we were able to get it working without issue on an older Mac running OS X 10.7.  Now that we have it up and running, what do we do with it?  I can't see myself using this tiny little cube for actual video because I'd just prefer to use my iPhone... Stopping there my review would have been 3 stars at best. The Cube is listed as 'Splash Resistant' meaning you can't take it into the pool... what to do, what to do? We purchased a waterproof case for $25 and the 3 star review immediately turned to a 5-star review and the product came to life.  My kids love it.  Much cheaper than the GoPro alternative which we already have, but the quality and output match.  Coupled with the waterproof case, this is a fun and highly versatile camera.

It is a simple plain camera with multi-colored stripes wrapped around the sides. It has a weather-proof lens with the microphone on the front side and has a micro SD card slot, 720p/ 1080p switch and a micro USB port on the back side with a cover. It has a magnet at the bottom and a multi-function button on the top to capture pictures and videos with an LED light on the top.<br /><br />Specifications :<br />The camera is a 35mm x 35mm x 35mm cube with 1.66 ounce weight.<br />It is equipped with a high quality 6 Mega Pixel camera which can record 720p or 1080p videos.<br />The camera supports up to 32GB class 10 micro SD card.<br />It comes with a 3MP CMOS Sensor<br />Wide angle lens of 124 degree.<br />Micro USB 2.0 Charging Point<br />It has a built-in Lithium Battery which can provide a power of 90 minutes.<br />Video Format is .MOV which needs Apple Quick Time or VLC Player. Picture Format is .JPG<br />The camera is weather-proof and water resistant.<br /><br />Functions :<br />It is very easy to record videos and take pictures with this camera. Double press the multi-function button to start recording the video, the LED light blink in red and there are two beep sounds to indicate the recording has started. To stop recording the video just press the button, the LED light becomes a solid green color and the camera makes a short beep sound to indicate the recording is stopped. There is no way to pause the recording and start recording again, which is one of the short comings of this camera. For taking pictures, just press the multi-function button once, The LED light blinks once with a beep sound to indicate a click.<br /><br />To turn the camera ON, press the multi-function button till the LED glows green and you hear 3 beeps sounds. Press and hold the same button to Switch OFF the camera till the LED light turns off. You can choose the resolution between 720p and 1080p with the switch button, the higher the resolution it takes up more space on the SD card and get shorter battery life. There is a charging cable included in the packaging. It can be charged using any USB port and the LED turns orange. When the battery is low it does beep and switches off when the battery gets completely discharged.<br /><br />It can also be used as a dash cam and it works perfectly. The video quality is great and the sound is also clear. The camera has 124 degree wide angle lens which is great as it covers a larger area or taking a picture of a large group of people.<br /><br />The cube has a mounting magnet that sticks to any metal surface easily. Simply attach the camera to skateboards, bicycle handlebar, helmet or a metal mount and your good to go. It does say the camera is water resistant and splash proof but I surely doubt that, would just use a water proof case to be safe.<br /><br />Limitations :<br />As there is no screen on the camera, you obviously cannot see what your recording or if the picture is well captured.<br />The video cannot be pause while recording.<br /><br />Packaging Includes :<br />Polaroid Cube<br />Micro USB Cable<br />User Guide<br /><br />I like that the Polaroid Cube comes in 3 different color options to choose from, Black, Blue and Red.<br /><br />Overall I really liked the&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Polaroid-POLC3-Cube-HD-Digital-Video-Action-Camera-Camcorder-Black/dp/B00NEYHIHM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Polaroid POLC3 Cube HD Digital Video Action Camera Camcorder (Black)</a>.<br />**This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes.

I did not have any trouble getting the SD card in as I saw in another review. My biggest complaint I guess is that it doesn't come with any of the accessories, In order to really use it and have fun you need at least the underwater case and the suction cup base as well as the SD card ( none of which come with the cube.. All those other products add up so that kind of stinks.. Next thing you know you have easily spent an extra 75 to 100 dollars to get geared up.. Also the reviews on some of the accessories are not that great which stinks because you don't really have other options.<br />Over all for the price it is not bad..

I ordered the blue one and just love how much the colors remind me of the old style polaroid cameras. The HD video quality is amazing; way better than you would expect for such a palm-sized camera. I love that it's simple enough for anyone to use. As soon as I opened the package and turn the camera on, our 9 year daughter was asking to use it. She took it on a bike ride and made a cute video of our neighborhood. It did get dropped but it's pretty durable and you can't even tell. The outer shell is easy to wipe clean if it gets a little dirty and it's weatherproof (NOT waterproof). We had it out during a little summer sprinkle and everything is still in tip-top shape but you wouldn't want to let it get too wet or it may get damaged.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a reduced price in exchange for providing my honest and unbiased opinion."

Polaroid,Polaroid Cube HD 1080p Lifestyle Action Video Camera (Blue),20150903,B00NEZ6OW6,2,0,0,"on September 3, 2015",ANONYMOUS,A Headache I Didn't Need,"I had high hopes for the Polaroid Cube, a compact (about a 1 1/2&#34; square) camera that allows you to take still shots as well as video.  I don't know if my expectations were too high, or if this is truly a badly conceived product. The promo made it look like you could just attach it to a bike or skateboard and it would take great video. I thought it might be fun for my grandkids. It's compact and attractive looking, and as I received it at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review, it didn't seem extraordinarily expensive. Sadly, the simple and compact device did not function as advertised.<br /><br />It needed to be charged before its first use (as does almost any electronic device), but a full 24 hours later, the charge light was still orange (not red, yellow or green). I waited a full extra day, but still no green charge light. I assumed maybe the light was just non-functional, and proceeded to try and use the device.<br /><br />The second problem is gaining access to the &#34;control panel&#34;, which lies underneath a silicone screw with a slot in it. You will always need a coin or some similar item to open the device, which I find unnecessarily inconvenient. The button is not attached to the camera, which makes chances for it to be lost almost inevitable.<br /><br />The directions were clear and precise; however, I feel it would be hard for most people to keep the steps needed for operation straight without written instructions. Instead of a few operational buttons, there is only one, which must be pressed one, two or three times, or held down for three seconds. For instance: hold the button down for three seconds to turn it on, at which point a green light appears and a beep sounds. To take a still shot, depress the button once. I did that, but the device gives you no way to know if you've actually taken a picture; no sound, no light, nothing. Also, there is no kind of view port, so you just have to point and shoot, hoping you're actually capturing that image of your baby, rather than the pile of laundry next to her.<br /><br />The same applies to video. Yes, the device is magnetized, so it will attach to handlebars on a bike. But there are few other pieces of equipment it would attach to. There is no snap or Velcro-type attachment for it, not even a lanyard to sling it around your neck.<br /><br />To take video requires another combination of presses on the single operating button. Again, no way to see what you're taking video of. It might be an awesome bike jump, or it might be the local school crossing guard. Who knows?<br /><br />To see any of the shots or video you take, a computer connection is required. The device comes with a tiny USB cable (which would be incredibly easy to lose). When I plugged it into my PC, nothing happened. The software didn't download, no dialog box appeared to direct me, just nothing.<br /><br />By this point, I was frustrated and annoyed, and grateful I didn't pay full price. I wrote it off as a dead loss. To be fair, I didn't try to return it, as I had foolishly thrown out the packing materials. Maybe I just got a lemon. But for me, there was no thought of making lemonade. I tossed it and moved on.<br /><br />If you decide to try this item, keep your shipping materials. I would never pay the listed retail price for this, even if it worked. Polaroid is usually a great name in fun family cameras, but for me, this was just a headache I didn't need."

Polaroid,Polaroid Cube HD 1080p Lifestyle Action Video Camera (Blue),20150902,B00NEZ6OW6,5,0,0,"on September 2, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Great little device,I received this from a special offer in exchange for a review.  I think it's a really neat little device overall.  Its tiny so can be easily carried in a pocket or purse.  Once you read the manual and learn the buttons it's simple to use. You can't see what you're filming or talking a picture of so it's hard to know what you have in view or not and the only way to know is by uploading it to a computer and seeing if you got the footage you wanted.  I had trouble with the video. Uploading it was fine but viewing it the sound in the video would play but the footage would stay frozen on the screen. I do think it's an issue with my video card and not the cube though.  The magnet on the bottom is really strong and attaches to many surfaces which allows for a lot of creative options for filming.  I wouldnt replace a digital camera with this only because i like to be able to preview my pictures and videos after ive taken them but this is a great simple little camera without bells and whistles.
Polaroid,Polaroid Cube HD 1080p Lifestyle Action Video Camera (Blue),20150902,B00NEZ6OW6,5,0,0,"on September 2, 2015",ANONYMOUS,awesome action camera!,"I wanted a fun little camera that took good videos and this Polaroid cube did just that for me.  Its a small camera measuring 1.4&#34; x 1.4&#34; around, so its pretty small, light weight, and easy to carry.  It came with a charging cord that doubles as a cord to connect to your computer, and of course the camera itself.  I fully charged it as soon it arrived and it didn't take very long to charge.  The camera was able to record almost 90 minutes without needing to be charged.  Its a really cute red colored water resistant cube with the rainbow stripes going around.  The front has the lens and the microphone to record audio, and the back has a removable panel that allows you to charge and insert a micro SD for memory.  This panel opens with a coin, its the size of a quarter, so I ended up using a quarter to open it up with no problems. There is also a switch that allows you to change from 720p to 1080p.  I like being able to switch to the quality I want.  The action cam gives great quality with 6mp, I was really impressed with both audio and sound quality.<br /><br />On the bottom of the camera is a magnet that dome shaped.  You can attach it to numerous accessories and its really strong and wont even move when its stuck to a surface.  On the top of the cube is a button, when you press it for a few seconds, the LEG light comes on turning on the device when it is green.  When you press it only one time, it will take a photo, and pressing it twice, the camera will begin recording, and to stop recording just press the button on the top once.  I love that I can use both features and its not just a camera because its hard to find a perfect moment to pull out my camera when I'm in the middle of recording something.  When you have a micro SD card inserted, you can have tons of fun with the action cam.  I transferred the videos and pictures to my computer with no problems at all and fairly easily using the cord provided and connect to my PC.  When I connected the Polaroid cube to the PC, I was prompted with software called PolaroidCube, that gave me options to change settings to the camera if I wanted to.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoy this camera and its so small and easy to take with you.  I can use it when my kids are playing outdoors, or when they start their sports in the fall.  It won't take up much room for me to carry.  I do wish it came with a carrying case or something to keep it safe when its put in my purse, or when traveling, but I love how compact and small it is to take with you wherever you go.<br /><br />Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

This little camera certainly packs a punch. We charged the battery and messed around with it well over an hour and it is still not dead. The pictures and video came in shockingly clear as well as the sound. I figured we would have to buy so many additional acessories for it but so far just the micro SD card, which is necessary because I do not believe this has internal storage at all. I like that you have a choice of 720 or 1080 and that you can switch back and forth as needed. It does have a wide angle lens which is great for scenic shots. I was skeptical about how well the magnet would hold, especially when we took it for ride on the dirt bike but surprisingly it held and made for a pretty awesome video!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Compact size<br />Long battery life<br />Magnet can be used to mount in a variety of places<br />Nice sound and video quality<br />Durable<br />weather/water proof (I am not sure, I have not dared to put it under<br />Compact size<br /><br />Cons:<br />No internal storage<br />Video was shaky on dirt bike but that is too be expected"

I like the choice of colors, you can get it in black, blue and red. I ordered mine in black to draw less attention to it. I didn't like the rainbow stripe, luckily it is a sticker, so I removed it so it's all black now. I had a bunch of fun with it. It can only take a micro sd card up to 32gb which isn't included. I like that it is tiny, I can carry it virtually anywhere with me and place it where a larger video camera couldn't. I like the magnetic bottom which is nice and it's pretty strong. I had it on a shopping cart rolling through the aisle of a supermarket. I do wish that there was another magnetic piece on the back of the cube and not just at the bottom for certain magnetic mounts. It's easy to use. Just hold down the top bottom for 3 seconds to turn it on or off. To snap a picture just press down once and to take a video press the button down 2 times to record and 1 time to stop. It beeps to let you know your modes. You can control the volume of the beep by installing the app on your computer. It does record in mov files so you'll need VLC or Quicktime to play it properly with audio. I do find the audio a bit muffled even when speaking close to the camera. If you're filming other people talking, the volume is very low when played back. I do find it a bit annoying that I have to use a coin each time to open or close the backplate. It does pretty good in low lighting. I was recording my friends and I pre drinking before going to the clubs and then at the club and it captured some very funny moments. Overall, I do love this camera for the basic video recording functions and size and price at $99 at this time. A newer wifi cube is also available.<br /><br />***I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review***"

It's compact, feels durable (although the polaroid branding that runs around the sides is actually just a sticker that feels like it could wear off over time), and has a magnet on the bottom which makes it handy for sticking to random metal objects.<br /><br />Don't make the mistake I did when first trying to use this... I dug out an old microsd card I had laying around and popped it in (since the camera doesn't come with an included microsd card, despite needing one to record anything) and I got really odd results, with videos cutting short anywhere from 1 minute and change into it, to just a few seconds into recording. The picture and video quality was also surprisingly grainy.  I was really frustrated... THEN, I read the instructions.  This little guy needs a Class 10 (or above) microsd card in order to perform well. After running out to Staples and grabbing one for $15, I couldn't be happier with this device.<br /><br />With an Ultra MicroSD card (class 10), the recording works as expected - breaking up your video into 5 minute long, continuous files and the camera delivers clear audio, video and photos. It also has a nice weight to it and feels good in the hand.<br /><br />All in all I really like it, but it definitely is more of a &#34;toy&#34; than a serious camera.  I plan to use it mostly for capturing video of my son as he gallivants on his daily adventures in the playground, or at the beach, or on a weekend trip out of the city. It's sturdy enough that I'm not worried about it breaking in his little toddler-sized hands, and small enough that he can either run around with it easily, or I can tack it on to something like his trike or stroller to capture life from his perspective.<br /><br />If you're looking for something for casual outdoor recording, that you don't have to be afraid of damaging while recording outdoors, I totally recommend it.<br /><br />Please note that I received this product in exchange for my honest review, which the above absolutely is."

It has a nice wide angle so you can capture anything you really point it at. I like the idea of the magnet on the bottom, however I wish they had also included a threaded port for attachment to a standard tripod mount. I know there are attachments you can buy but this would not have been to hard to include in the original design. The red color is pretty bright/pale/pink looking. I've included a picture next to a bottle of ketchup for comparison. If I had the option to choose color, I'd go with the black.<br /><br />The controls are a little limiting as they are so simple. You can't really do multiple pictures in a row as it takes the device a little time to process the capture. The lens is completely exposed and I would recommend a case if doing anything extreme. This little guy will be fun to have on trips and we are planning on taking on our honeymoon. It will be a nice little camera to have that won't allow us to perfect the photos - since there isn't a screen to review the images. We will just have to &#34;see&#34; what pops out of it once we connect it to the computer. Hopefully, this will add some fun to taking pictures with this little guy. Although I receive this camera at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I would suggest it over a GoPro for those looking for a cheaper alternative. However, if you are looking for a camera for someone who may eventually move on to nicer equipment (such as a high end GoPro), you might want to purchase one of the older model GoPros. This will allow them to use all of their accumulated equipment/accessories as they move on to nicer cameras.<br /><br />That said, if you're looking for a little fun camera to leave around the house for impromptu pictures or to strap onto a helmet then this might be the camera for you. If you're looking for something pretty rugged, invest in a Go Pro."

The wide angle lens allows you to get the entire scene that you are trying to shoot.

I was surprised how small the device is, but I really appreciate its size because it makes it incredibly versatile and easy to take on the go. There is a small insert in the box that shows you how to turn it on, off, and take pictures and video. I'll admit I was a little confused about getting it to turn off because it says to hold for 3 seconds. However it's more like 5 seconds so don't get confused when it starts taking a picture instead of turning off. To take video you double tap the button. A picture is one push.

On that note while it's charging on a computer it shows an indicator light, but when you charge it in a wall outlet there's no way to know when it's done charging which is weird. When you plug it into the computer there is a program that you can open where you can watch the videos and view photos. I had heard that the sound wouldn't work so I tried for myself and this is true. I downloaded QuickTime which was a little difficult on my windows 10 PC so that's a downfall. I am planning to buy the mounting accessories and waterproof case so that I can test it on my snowmobile but its not winter yet so i cant attest to that. I received this product at a deep discount for my honest review. I am happy to have been able to get this camera because I have been wanting something like this for a while and am excited to continue seeing all that it can do!"
Polaroid,Polaroid Cube HD 1080p Lifestyle Action Video Camera (Blue),20150817,B00NEZ6OW6,4,0,0,"on August 17, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Small and compact i can take it anywhere.,This camera is very cute and compact. It's just a littlebit wider than a quarter. I like that I can take it anywhere with me. I bought the necklace that it attaches to because it's more convenient and I know where it is if I want to take quick picture or video plus I like taking it with me when I'm hiking.  The videos have wide angle view and very clear both picture and audio. The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because there is no way of checking the pictures as I'm taking them until I upload them. It is suppose to be water resistant not water proof so don't submerge it under water. It's should be safe in a light rain. I love that I can buy several different attachments including a waterproof case at affordable prices. The camera/video is very easy to switch back and forth. The cube is very simple to use and upload to computer. This camera in my opinion is good for someone just starting out or someone that's been doing these types of videos for awhile. I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.

Unboxing it was a little difficult  to me, but after inserting my sd card, I was good to go! It is a very simple way to take pictures and videos. The media was lifelike with its wide angle lens. Pictures were around 1.5mb and a 1 minute video is from 60mb. If you do not want to disconnect the sd card, you can simply connect the microusb charging cable into the computer and view it directly. I tried to use the camera on my skateboard (penny/plastic) and its not magnetic so it did not work. You can stick it on a fridge and do cooking vlogs which would work great! One project I am interested in seeing is if this will work as a dash cam, however, there is only a 90minute battery life.<br />this product was sent to me for an unbiased review"

I was expecting better video quality than my smartphone, but what I got was grainy video and no sound. For the price, I'd recommend a GoPro Hero 2.

I received it at a discounted price in exchange for a completely honest review, and honestly didn't see myself using it too often as I'm not terribly sporty. But I found myself using it as a tiny portable camera very frequently. I would keep it in my purse and whenever I wanted to take a picture or video of something it was conveniently there. It was so much less bulky than a normal camera.<br /><br />There's a feature on the back to change the quality from 1080p to 720p which is super appreciated since sometimes you want great quality and sometimes you want to get more pics on your SD card. The magnetic surface on the bottom is extremely strong. I feel very secure attaching it to the front of my bike and can't imagine a situation that would actually be violent enough to cause it too detach.<br /><br />The audio quality is great, for what it is. Obviously if you're filming with a lot of wind or background noise it'll be hard to hear yourself but I feel that's to he expected. The process of uploading the videos and pictures to your computer is very simple and easy.<br /><br />All in all, I really love my little camera cube. It's convenient and portable, easy to use and great quality. I sincerely and truly would recommend this to anyone, friend or stranger."

It has a really cool form and the internal magnet is slick.  Unfortunately I got one use before the camera stopped recording video. I bought the waterproof suction mount and I haven't even been able to use it because the camera won't work any more. It beeps several times and blinks an orange light every time I try to record video, and it shuts off.  Card reformats and reseats make no difference. Different cards don't work either. I tried to take it to the park to record my baby daughter and almost threw it in the lake I was so frustrated.  Don't be stupid like me, spend the extra $30 and get a GoPro.  This product is just not up to snuff.  I'll be buying a GoPro and figuring out to do with this waste of money now."

I immediately opened it with care, read the instructions, and loaded the film. Then I tried to load the batteries.

Since I had used the batteries that came with the product, and included batteries are usually subpar, I thought nothing of it and went out to buy namebrand batteries. In spite of this effort, the camera still does not work. It flashes the low battery lights, no matter what brand of newly-purchased batteries I load it with.

Sure the pictures don't always come out perfectly, it takes a little trial and error but that's what you get with a Polaroid instant camera. Its always going to be like that. I find the picture quality perfect for my needs.<br />I've seen people on here say that theirs worked great for a time and suddenly stopped working. Mine did the same thing. Changed the batteries eTc. I figured out that the paper had jammed. There is really no easy way to fix it without wasting one or two prints. Just open the back, pull out cartridge and push the first print up through the slot. Replace the cartridge and press the shutter button. The next picture should print out but it will not develop. The picture after that one should be good with maybe a slight discoloring.<br />Overall I absolutely love this camera. And everyone who sees it is intrigued by it and wants a demonstration. Which can get expensive since the film is about $1 a picture. But in love it for my smashbooking it's perfect."

It's a perfect gift for someone who loves to keep memories and have physical photos rather than having them all on fb/your phone. The camera has a very simple design and it's very easy to use.

But the quality of photos for this camera is pretty dull and lifeless. It won't capture moments, and  even by looking in the lens and seeing your subject, it will cut off some of the photo that was in your view. I initially wanted to return it because I wasn't real happy with it, but decided to keep it for the instant gratification, and using it only for things I may want to immediately add to my Project Life journal. It hasn't become my &#34;go-to&#34; camera by any means."

While camera functions properly and does what is advertised, the pictures are far too small to be useful!  I purchased camera as a christmas present because years ago I had an original Polaroid and although it was a bit awkward to use it took good pictures the same size as a regular camera.  This new camera takes a picture, ejects from camera very well, but when the picture comes out , you need a magnifying glass to see the subjects.  While they might be good for your wallet, unless your just doing head shots its pretty much useless.  I'm sure had it not been a christmas gift it would have been returned.  I would not recommend."

I've had it for around two years now and it works just as great as the day I got it. The photos this camera produces are beyond beautiful and I wish all cameras could make its subjects look as amazing and flawless as this one does. I made sure to have my Polaroid camera at my wedding reception back in November of 2013 and it was most definitely one of the best decisions I ever made. The result was an amazing array of photos capturing the true spirit of the day. I couldn't be happier with the way the photos came out and I really feel that they added even more beauty to my already beautiful wedding.<br /><br />The only negative part of this camera is the cost of the film (which is insanely expensive). The film is definitely worth the splurge if you're going to be bringing your camera on a trip or to an important event. However, the price of film makes this camera an item I can and will only use on the most special of occasions. I really do wish that the film was a bit cheaper though, so that I could use my camera a bit more in my day to day life. Until that price drop happens, I'll be saving my Polaroids for road trips and weddings."

Most of the old film is expired and every picture taken will require holding your breath while it comes out...<br />This is a great alternative, but be cautious, this isn't a perfect product either. The film works, it's about wallet size. It looks pretty cool when the image comes out. The quality is good, no complaints. The major complaint comes in with the camera... If the flash doesn't work, you're screwed. I've learned from experience and through other people: the flash tends to malfunction. When that goes, your camera is dead for good and your film is done. Make sure when you get the camera, the flash works. If you find that your images aren't coming out, it's because of the flash. If you put film in and started using it, be cautious when pulling it out. You'll have to exchange the camera and get one with a properly functioning flash. Make sure to pull the film out of the broken camera in a dark, dark room, so you can use what remains of the film that didn't get used up in the broken camera. You'll definitely expose the most outside film, but you can save the remaining ones. This is good because the film isn't cheap.... Otherwise you risk exposing the film to light and ruining most of them. The ones on the back end will get a nice effect from the exposure - if you're looking for a quirky effect on the sides - but it's definitely not appealing to most.<br /><br />Again, be cautious. Make sure the flash on the camera works. The size and quality of the images is good. But the quality of the camera product is questionable and fairly cheap..."

I teach internationally and I have been wanting an Instamatic so I could take pictures of locals and give it to them. The pictures are quite small, credit card size, but it's ok. To try out the camera, I took pictures of my friends first. I now have a number of pics I hang on a picture clothesline in my apartment. They are a good size for that. As for quality, I was using Fuji instant mini film which is a bit cheaper than Polaroid but still about $1/picture. The quality was pretty good, not great but good enough for what I was doing. Only problem was the flash goes off no matter what the conditions are outside. On pictures I took on a cloudy day, the pictures were completely washed out. I could hardly see the subjects.

I immediately opened it with care, read the instructions, and loaded the film. Then I tried to load the batteries. From the onset, three red lights started blinking in unison, which apparently means that the batteries need to be replaced. Since I had used the batteries that came with the product, and included batteries are usually subpar, I thought nothing of it and went out to buy namebrand batteries. In spite of this effort, the camera still does not work. It flashes the low battery lights, no matter what brand of newly-purchased batteries I load it with. I looked my issue up, and apparently, this defect is fairly common and there is no known solution. My recommendation is to not waste your time or money; if you receive this product with a quality similar to that of mine, the risk eclipses the reward."

Then receiving the camera and realizing that Socialmatic so obviously has ZERO partnership with Instagram.<br /><br />I bought this product for a very specific reason, to be able to take pictures that automatically got uploaded onto social media sites and to have the option of printing a picture right there on the spot.<br /><br />Their &#34;socialmatic&#34; wanna-be social media site, forces itself on you and it's absolutely awful. It can connect to Facebook or Twitter, but not easily. You have to create an individual message for each. The interface is incredibly slow, so if you wanted to take a picture that goes to both of these sites, expect to be messing with the unresponsive touch screen for 10 minutes. (stylus' don't work).<br /><br />The easier solution would be to post straight to Instagram, since all you have to do is check the FB and Twitter box in order to post to all three simultaneously. I had to download the Instagram app (you would think this camera would come with it, but it doesn't). In order to not drag on, here's a bullet list of why this camera cannot work with instagram<br /><br />- It inverts the view screen. So when on the instagram app, you see everything upside down no matter how you turn the camera.<br />- You don't push the button on the camera to take the pic, you have to use the (really bad) touch screen<br />- Once you take the picture, it's automatically right side up, when it takes you to editing place<br />- The above would be a good thing, if it didn't weirdly crop your picture<br />- So, not only is your viewfinder inverted and forces you to take the picture upside down, but what you want within the frame of your picture won't necessarily be there. (ex. I took a picture of my coworker sitting on a chair where he filled out the frame, the picture came out and cropped off his head)<br /><br />---- For those who bought the camera, and are opting to keep it, I found that turning the camera sideways gave you a slightly more framed picture...<br /><br />In the end, it was an interesting idea to bring the polaroid technology into the modern era but very poorly executed and not worth the price. Having instaprint pictures is a fun thing, but I would definitely go for the cheaper version of this camera or wait until they get their act together. The Polaroid Socialmatic should be penalized for grievously misleading marketing and the idea that this is the &#34;Instagram Camera&#34;"

Polaroid,Polaroid Socialmatic Instant Digital Camera (Black),20150213,B00QFVKXIC,3,4,6,"on February 13, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Unique Concept - Frustrating Implementation,"Remember the older Polaroid cameras that gave you instant photos that you flapped in the air until the print came into focus?  This camera is so far beyond that concept it's startling.  It’s a Polaroid camera and its own Android tablet for multiple uses.  The only immediate problem is that there are NO instructions and it isn't intuitive.<br /><br />The package of photos are a little larger than business cards (2&#34; X 3&#34;) although the color and crispness is worthy of a Polaroid.  It uses a process called &#34;Zink&#34; for 'zero ink' which is kind of neat.  Unlike most 'point and shoot' in this same price range, it is not small, but rather bulky (5.25&#34; X 5.25&#34; X 1.1&#34; thick).  Of course, the older Polaroid cameras were bulky too, but this is a new century.  The front has a 14 Megapixel camera and a screen with a smiley face that shows it is on or charging.  On the back is a viewer screen (about 4&#34; X 2&#34;) and a 2 megapixel camera.  There is an internal memory of 4 GB, but to store more photos and information you can slide a microSD card in the side (8 GB - 32 GB recommended).  There is also built-in Wi-Fi, GPS and Bluetooth.<br /><br />On the back screen of the camera there are lots of features that enable you to touch -up your photographs with great software.  There are special effects, red-eye, cropping, exposure adjustment, orientation control, special effects and more.  There is also a touch keyboard, but it's frustratingly small.<br /><br />This camera shoots stills and videos, however still were a bit problematic after being used to a 'point n shoot'.  There is a slight pause on the button so the slowness can be unsettling if something moves and blurs.  The camera does have to self-focus.  Photos that succeed do turn out well, especially since there is a bright flash on the camera.<br /><br />As far as the Android and no instructions, I found this to be the most frustrating part.  You really have to spend several hours playing with the camera to get to know all the extras and special features.  Access to Facebook and other Bluetooth uses is tough to figure out, although it is possible.  When I tried to post to Facebook, I had trouble keeping a connection.  I don't if this is me or a problem with a new device, but it was frustrating.<br /><br />This is a good concept of combining instant photographs with an Android interface and I suspect once the bugs are fixed, it will be a very popular item, but for the price and issues that current along with no instructions, this makes for a frustrating mix.  Next year should produce a truly good product.  This product was supplied for an honest review."

And it's totally what I expected, amazing. It's a tablet, camera, and a printer! Of course it's gonna be kinda bulky. The touch screen is a little unresponsive and small but besides when I'm trying to type something it's not that big of an issue.<br />It starts up like a tablet so it takes a minute and then if you hold the big button down for a couple seconds it'll open the camera app up for you.<br />Not everything comes with a step by step manual, explore the camera guys it's not hard to figure out.<br />It dies a little quick, but I've also been downloading apps and playing with the camera while it was on sooo.<br />If you don't like the app for the camera (or the editing software) you can go to the play store and download your own and then when you are done go to the gallery and choose print and it'll print.<br />I haven't had an issue with either camera app crashing, but if I go to change my personal settings (like my picture for the tablet) it crashes but that's purely for personal use and not really anything anyone will see besides me.<br />I don't regret this buy at all it's literally so amazing and I'm super happy<br /><br />Ps i had the z2300 Polaroid and I always had issues with the printer not working or the back opening and spilling my zinc paper all over. It never registered the paper, I had to hold it shut. Like this is a huge step up."
Polaroid,Polaroid Socialmatic Instant Digital Camera (Black),20150211,B00QFVKXIC,3,7,10,"on February 11, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Also no instructions pretty much. One of the biggest cons is that ...,"More of a tablet than a camera. Also no instructions pretty much. One of the biggest cons is that there is no QuickStart to camera to point and click. So every time you want to use this thing you have to unlock it and open one of the camera apps. The one designed for the camera takes kind of long to start and thus kind of takes away spontaneity. Also sometimes the screen in unresponsive. It's a cool product that could use a few tweaks to make it shine.<br /><br />After a few weeks I have this to add:<br />Whether you are using the camera or not the battery drains. For instance, I charged the camera 100% and took a few pictures and printed them. I had 80% battery when I turned the camera on standby- much like a tablet you can turn it off or tap the power button to have it on but locked with the display off. Well this drains the battery so that a few hours later the camera was dead. If you turn the camera off it may take 1-2 minutes to start up. Again, this takes away from the spontaneity of some pictures. The pictures come out great though! A little dark at times, but they stick on great and get some great detail despite the small size. Despite the negativity I love the camera. It just needs some adjustments."

Forgot people complaining for sure they just got a bad lemon. The one I received works great the picture quality is for sure not a professional quality but I am not asking a perfect picture for that I will use my USB key and go to a professional shop. The pictures are just great to catch a great moment and hand it over to my friend or to put on my picture wall just to remind me how fun was last night. I downloaded Facebook and Instagram and my camera does not go upside down or shut off by itself or anything of that. The selfie camera is a bit slower than the normal camera but the picture is still good !<br />This camera is not a toy otherwise it would cost $5.99 in Wal-Mart but it's a great purchase for someone who doesn't know anything about professional camera and is not looking for anything more than capture great moment, post them fast on Facebook or Instagram and print some crazy moment."

Polaroid,Polaroid Socialmatic Instant Digital Camera (Black),20150207,B00QFVKXIC,4,40,44,"on February 7, 2015",ANONYMOUS,"A unique device, but instructions are sadly lacking","<div id='video-block-R1C988KIIH3MKJ' class='a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block'></div><input type='hidden' name='' value='http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/E1t5YEq0L6S.mp4' class='video-url'><input type='hidden' name='' value='http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61x289L1sIS.png' class='video-slate-img-url'>I was in college in the 1960s when I bought my first Polaroid instant camera, a Polaroid 'Swinger.' It produced small grainy black-and-white photos, but I loved that camera. A couple of years later, I bought my first 35 mm camera and never looked back. Fast forward almost a half-century, and now Polaroid has the Socialmatic, which combines the functions of a digital camera and a small tablet, and it produces prints of your photographs in a few seconds. The device measures 5.2'x5.2'x1.2' and weighs 15 ounces.<br /><br />I'll first describe the tablet functions. The Socialmatic uses the Android 4.4.2 ('KitKat') operating system, and setting up and using the tablet will be a snap for anyone who's used an Android phone or tablet. The first thing I did was to pop in a 16 GB SDHC memory card (not required, but very useful for storing music, photos, and other files). Connecting to my home wi-fi was quick. Some apps are pre-installed, and I installed a number of my favorite apps, and all of them ran well, including the Chrome web browser, email, and games like 'Where's my Water.' One of the things I like most about Android is that when I signed into my Google account, my email contacts and Chrome bookmarks synced and were available immediately.<br /><br />The Socialmatic's 4½' (diagonal measurement) smartphone-type display has a 480x854 pixel resolution. I viewed some sports and videos, and the images were crisp with good color and contrast. The range of viewing angles was good, but they were more restrictive than most high-end tablets and phones that I've seen.<br /><br />The 1800mAh battery is not user-replaceable. In order to get an idea about battery life, I tested the battery by streaming full-screen video with sound on, and the battery lasted a few minutes short of four hours before dying. For typical mixed use of web browsing, reading, music, and apps, I expect that the battery will last significantly longer than that. After draining the battery, I used the included AC charger (12V/3A) to recharge the device, which took about 1½ hours.<br /><br />The audio from the single little speaker on the front of the phone isn't very impressive, but it's decent enough for a small mobile device like this. With no background noise, the maximum volume is satisfactory, but you may want to have an auxiliary Bluetooth speaker or headphones handy if the ambient noise is high. One noticeable omission: there's no earphone jack.<br /><br />The phone has front and rear cameras. The device specs indicate that the rear camera is 14MP (4192x3104) and the front camera is 2MP (1600x1200). The rear camera has an LED flash that can be turned on, turned off, or set to automatic. The camera has the typical Android camera controls, and you can use the standard Android camera app or the Socialmatic's own controls. There is a physical shutter release button on top of the device, or you can use the software button on the display screen. Both the front and rear cameras will shoot video as well as still images. One thing I didn't like - there's a noticeable lag between pressing the shutter release and taking the picture.<br /><br />I connected the Socialmatic to my PC with a USB cable (not included), and it appeared in Windows Explorer as a USB mass storage device (as did the micro-SDHC card that I had inserted). That enables you to drag and drop files between the PC and the Socialmatic. Another feature I really like (and isn't available on all tablets and phones that I've used) is the ability to connect a USB flash drive to the Socialmatic with an adapter (not included, but they're very inexpensive). This enables you to view images and play music directly from a flash drive.<br /><br />I used the Antutu Benchmark app to check the device's performance, and it scored 22,894, which Antutu labels as a 'Good' score. Frankly, I'm not geeky enough to discuss the merits of the Socialmatic's 32-bit dual core 1.5 GHz CPU, but subjectively, the device appears in most respects to be very responsive. (By comparison, my Moto X [2013 model] smartphone scored 25,982.)<br /><br />Overall, I'll give the Socialmatic good marks for its tablet functions. Now for the other functions. The Zink 'zero ink' printer that's built into the Socialmatic is what really makes this a unique product. The 2'x3' color prints take only a few seconds to print, and even though the quality of the prints isn't nearly as good as that of an inkjet print, it's fun to take a picture and spit out a hardcopy print a few seconds later. To a generation of younger folks who didn't grow up with Polaroid cameras, it's almost like magic.<br /><br />But the magic stopped for me at this point. The Socialmatic includes a user guide as a PDF file stored in the device's memory. The user guide is helpful in going over the Android functions, but it ends there. There is a small card in the packaging that shows how to connect the Socialmatic to your wi-fi and launch the Socialmatic app, but the last step simply says 'Shoot. Print. Share!' After that, you're on your own. In fairness, the PDF file does include this:<br /><br />Photo Sharing:<br />a) After editing photo, click [arrow symbol] to enter the sharing screen.<br />b) Click 'next' to upload the photo to 'SocialMatic.<br /><br />And once you're taken a picture, if you want to edit it and add a frame or other photo effects, it's fairly simple to figure out how to do it from the menus, but regarding sharing and using the Socialmatic network, I've spent hours googling 'Socialmatic' and watching YouTube videos, and I still don't have a good understanding of how it works. I did add a QR code and a selfie to my photos, and the photos did upload to the Socialmatic website, but beyond that, I'm lost. I scanned the QR code with a QR app on my phone, but it came back as a meaningless text string instead of a web page like I expected.<br /><br />The Socialmatic has a smaller 1.2'x1.2' LCD window on the front. According to the Socialmatic web page, 'Mood Assistant helps you find new followers thanks to the personal QR code that shows the camera's feelings.' But again, there's no information on how this feature works. I still haven't figured it out.<br /><br />Okay, the bottom line: I'm frustrated. I have a feeling that the Socialmatic could be a really fun device, especially for people who are seriously into using digital social media, but without some instructions or someone who's familiar with the device to show how to use it, it's not nearly as capable as it could be. Even the Socialmatic webpage shows what it will do, but nothing about how to do it.<br /><br />One more thing: Weighing almost a pound and with its square shape, the Socialmatic is not ideally designed for hand-held photography. If I was using it regularly, I would want one of the cases with a neck strap that's made for it.<br /><br />I know this a new product, so there are bound to be some hiccups. After registering with Socialmatic, I received this email: 'Next week we'll release tons of updates, both on Photonetwork and Camera, so please send your feedback and suggestions.' Hopefully there will be some helpful information on using the Socialmatic.<br /><br />The Polaroid Socialmatic was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review."

Polaroid,Polaroid Socialmatic Instant Digital Camera (Black),20150201,B00QFVKXIC,5,0,0,"on February 1, 2015",ANONYMOUS,A fantastic blend of old and new technologies that are perfect for “sharing” (abbreviated manual included) ...,"There are all kinds of tech specs many want to know about anything they’re going to purchase. Yes, they are important, but what about the Polaroid Socialmatic’s blend of old and new technologies? What I’m now able to hold in my hand is just that. If I want, I can use the old-fashioned technology the Polaroid Land camera had to offer, snap a picture and have it come out of the side of ... an Android tablet. It’s a total draw, a conversation piece, and something a multi-generational family can use.<br /><br />The Polaroid Socialmatic has 75 years worth of camera technology that’s now using ZINK (zero ink) imaging technology. It’s a revolutionary process and the only thing you’ll have to purchase for this camera is the ZINK photo paper. The tech talk is that it has an ARM A9 processor and uses KitKat, the Android 4.4.2 processing system. I’m finding it to be practically intuitive to work and I’m also pleased to see that it utilizes a GPS system to tag the location of my pictures.<br /><br />There’s no user manual in the box. There’s a single sheet of paper with basic instructions to get you started. Android is updated, you’ll choose things like your language, country, and time zone, connect to your WiFi network, and then you’ll reboot. If you make an error in your WiFi password, simply click on “Forget” and start again. If you have difficulty working on small keyboards, I suggest you have a small stylus on hand to enter your password.<br /><br />If you are tech-challenged (many in the Polaroid generation are) have someone help you with the initial steps and begin exploring. Perhaps you can consider this review to be a manual of sorts, but if you are familiar with the basic Android system, you can simply take a pass. The Socialmatic App has all of this information plus some. For example, if you are more advanced, you’ll find out how you can use the USB debugging mode.<br /><br />► SELECTING YOUR WALLPAPER:<br /><br />One of the first things I wanted to do was set my wall paper. I unlocked my screen by touching the lock and swiping to the right. In order to access the wallpaper options, you can simply use a long press (put and hold one finger on the screen) until the options come up. there are three options: Gallery (your own pictures), Live Wallpapers, and Picture Gallery.<br /><br />The Picture Gallery is a cool selection of interesting pictures. Simply scroll to the right until you find one, select and set. If you use the the any of the Live Wallpapers, the graphics will be a bit of a battery drain. I prefer them (try love them), and don’t mind. I’m listing the Live Wallpapers listed below. It’s a very nice variety of wallpapers to suit any mood.<br /><br />Live Wallpapers:<br /><br />Black Hole<br />Bubbles<br />Halo Spiral<br />Magic Smoke<br />Musical Wallpaper<br />Nexus<br />Phase Beam<br />Water<br /><br />► TECH SPECS:<br /><br />~► 1.5 Ghz dula-core CPU<br />~► Mali400 GPU provides smooth 1080P video capability<br />~► 4.5 inch screen WVGA with 480 * 854 resolution<br />~► Printing function: the Socialmatic prints the photograph immediately after taken<br />~► GPS chip functionality integrated with software to provide accurate Geo location of your pictures (it tags them)<br />~► Wi-Fi: Support wireless network function<br />~► Accelerometer functionality allows correct screen display with rotation of the device<br /><br />HARDWARE SPECS:<br /><br />Platform:<br /><br />~► CPU: Dual-core ARM CORTEX-A9 (1.5GHz)<br />~► Graphics: MALI 400<br />~► Screen: 4.5”, 480 x 854, 160K<br />~► Touch Panel: Capacitative Touch Screen (Single Point & Gesture)<br />~► Memory / RAM: 4GB<br />~► Storage: Micro SD (Supports up to 32GB)<br /><br />Network:<br /><br />~► Wi-Fi: 802.11b / g / n<br />~► Bluetooth: V2.0<br />~► Internal GPS<br /><br />Interface:<br /><br />~► USB: Micro-USB2.0 (5-pin); Support OTG<br />~► Battery charging: DC<br />~► Storage Interface: Micro SD; support 32G<br /><br />Camera:<br /><br />~► Host Camera: 13.0MP, Auto-focusing<br />~► Front Camera: 2.0MP, Fixed focus<br /><br />Battery:<br /><br />~► 1800mA / 7.4V<br /><br />Sensor:<br /><br />~► Acceleration Sensor: Support; Auto Switch<br /><br />► WI-FI NETWORK SETUP:<br /><br />The setup is easy and the user is guided through the process. Remember to follow the steps outline on the slip of paper inside the box. I briefly discussed this above. Once you are done, you’re ready to go. It’s not imperative that you launch the Socialmatic app immediately, but you do need to get that upgrade to the software.<br /><br />Simply tap your die-like icon on the bottom in the center and slide your Wi-Fi switch. There will be an automatic scan of Wi-Fi networks in your area. Tap on the one you wish to connect to and add your password. If you make an error, tap “Forget” and start again. If your Wi-Fi network is hidden, tap “Add Wi-Fi network” and follow the instructions. Later when you tap this center icon you’ll be able to access your Apps and Widgets.<br /><br />The Socialmatic interface is clean and uncluttered. Rather minimalist actually, but you can access anything you can on your iPad, PC, or tablet with a simple tap or swipe. I moved my clock out of sight with a quick slide to the left (right or left, no matter). What you see is the Google search bar, Google talk (gtalk) on the top, icons for the Google Play Store, Google browser, Apps / Widgets, the camera settings (Smart Access), and settings on the bottom. Beneath that you have a back button for the last thing you looked at, a home button, visuals of pages you’ve recently looked at, and a volume button.<br /><br />► POWER SWITCH:<br /><br />We all know how to turn on something with a power button. The Socialmatic is not different. Tap the power switch on the top and your screen will come on. On the other hand, the power switch can be used as a tool to change parameters. If you hold the power switch for a couple of seconds a screen will come up. You can turn the Socialmatic off, reboot, enable the Airplane or sound (vibrate or silent) modes. A simple tap and OK will activate these functions.<br /><br />► TOUCH SCREEN NAVIGATION:<br /><br />For many Apple users the touch screen navigation is a real plus. What I might call a long press, it can also be known as a “touch & hold.” For example, when I wanted to find my wallpaper options I used the long press or touch & hold method on the main screen. When you are working on the Socialmatic, you’ll quickly become accustomed to these navigation methods.<br /><br />For example, I have Google mail (Gmail). If I lightly hold my finger in the upper left-hand corner and slide my finger down, I can see the time and the recent messages I’ve received. It’s actually quite fun to explore using the touch screen navigation methods to find new things. It’s a learning process that’s quite cool.<br /><br />~► Tap: Quick tap & release on an item on the screen.<br />~► Touch & Hold: touch & hold for approximately 2 seconds, then release to display options window.<br />~► Finger slide: Touch and slide your finger across the screen and then release.<br />~► Two points to zoom in or out: Press and hold any tow points on the screen - separate to zoom in or pinch to zoom out.<br /><br />U-DISK / USB Flash Drive<br /><br />You can utilize your U-Disk or USB Flash Drive by using a USB host transfer cable. Use the file browser and then check out the USB folder the view the contents.<br /><br />When you remove your U-Disk or Flash Drive tap your settings icon. Go to storage, USB storage, unmount the storage device, and wait until “Mount this device” shows up and then you can remove your device of choice.<br /><br />MICRO-SD card<br /><br />You Micro-SD card will click when it’s inserted properly. Similar to the U-Disk, you tap your settings icon and repeat the process.<br /><br />► PRE-LOADED APPLICATIONS:<br /><br />~► Clock: Display time and set alarm.<br />~► Browser: Access the Internet<br />~► Camera: Take photos, panoramic photos and video<br />~► Calculator: Perform simple calculation<br />~► Recorder: Recording and playback of audio<br />~► Email: Send / Receive email using your existing email address<br />~► File Browser: File manager application for viewing and managing files and apps. Use to install Android apps and to backup files to your SD card<br />~► My Music: Play and manage audio files<br />~► Gallery: Play, Browse, or Manage Video and Photo files<br />~► Screen Capture: Capture image of the current screen<br />~► Downloads: View downloaded files and download progress<br />~► Settings: Multiple settings for personalizing your device<br />~► GPS: GPS<br />~► MAP: Map<br />~► Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi<br />~► Bluetooth: Bluetooth<br />~► Voice search: Voice search<br />~► Socialmatic: App allows full color printing of images immediately after capture<br />~► Hangouts: Multi-user video conference, contact, & communicate with friends<br />~► Acceleration Sensor: Measures the acceleration of the units<br />~► Gmail: Google Mail Service<br />~► Google Search Engine<br />~► Google Setting: Google App Settting<br />~► Google Play: Google App Store<br /><br />Now that I’ve outlined the bare -bones aspects of the Sociomatic, I’ll outline briefly what else you’ll be able to manage and access via Apps and Widgets. Although I do prefer a paper manual, the fact that all the information one will need in the Sociomatic app is appreciated by the eco-friendly crowd and those used to reading online. I will, however, list what’s in the settings.<br /><br />► STATUS AND NOTIFICATIONS:<br /><br />On your desktop screen, head to the upper left-hand corner. Your notifications (email, time date) will open up when you touch lightly and slide in a downward motion.<br /><br />► APPLICATION MANAGEMENT:<br /><br />You’ll learn how to install Android Applications, download Applications from websites, and uninstall Android Applications. Heading to the Google Play Store is an easy way to find many you’ll want. For example, I was easily able to download my favorite weather app to my desktop.<br /><br />► CLOCK:<br /><br />You’ll learn how to set your alarm (add, shut off alarm alert, turn alarm on, edit, and delete alarm), work with the Countdown, and use the Stopwatch feature.<br /><br />► INTERNET BROWSER:<br /><br />Simply tapping the Internet browser (globe) on the desktop will bring you to the Google search engine. Once you are on a page and want to move to another, tap the address at the top. Your keyboard will come up and you can start to type in another address. It takes a bit of practice to use your browser easily.<br /><br />► CALENDAR:<br /><br />Using the calendar app is intuitive. Tap the app and an actual calendar comes up. Tap on the day you wish to add an event, enter it, and tap done. You can easily see what day it is on the calendar. It’s also displayed along with the time on the Sociomatic desktop screen.<br /><br />► CAMERA:<br /><br />You’ll learn how to take pictures, take videos, and switch into single-motion panorama mode.<br /><br />► CALCULATOR:<br /><br />This is the calculator many of us use on Google. Once you are finished with your calculations, you can use the delete button to delete your calculation digit by digit or hold delete for a couple of seconds and it clears them all immediately.<br /><br />► RECORDING:<br /><br />You can actually record from the Sociomatic. You can select your recording quality, time, the default recording file name, and select the default storage devices.<br /><br />► EMAIL:<br /><br />I quickly and easily set up my Gmail account, which I can see what’s coming in by checking the upper left-hand corner of my desktop for notifications. If I have anything incoming I want to take a closer look at, I go into my apps and click my Gmail to read.<br /><br />POP3, SMTP and Exchange accounts are supported. You can delete email accounts later if you so choose.<br /><br />► FILE BROWSER:<br /><br />You can view all the files you have stored on your tablet. This includes those you’ve added from your SD card, USB device, and things like Ringtones and the user manual for the Sociomatic itself. You can tap and hold to delete files.<br /><br />► GALLERY:<br /><br />This is simply where all your pictures and videos are stored. You can classify your pictures, open them up to view, create a Slideshow, etc. Photos can be shared, deleted, or printed if you so desire.<br /><br />► SETTINGS:<br /><br />Wireless & Internet:<br /><br />~► Open the Wi-Fi, set up and manage the wireless access point<br />~► Open the Bluetooth and connect a Bluetooth device<br />~► Airplane Mode<br /><br />FUNCTION:<br /><br />Sound<br /><br />~► Volume: Set volume<br />~► Default Sound: Set the default notification ringtone<br />~► Touch Sound: Turn on or off the Warning Tone<br />~► Screen Lock Sound: Turn on or off Lock Screen<br />~► Volume Icon: Turn on or off the volume icon in the status bar<br /><br />Display<br /><br />~► Brightness: Adjust the screen brightness<br />~► Wallpaper: Set the wallpaper<br />~► Sleep: Set the device sleep time<br />~► Screen Saver: Set the interactive screen saver<br />~► Font Size: Set the font size<br />~► Wireless Display<br />~► Auto-Rotate: Set auto-rotation of screen On / Off<br /><br />Storage<br /><br />~► Select the default storage devices to read and write, check the internal storage, viewing, unload and format the SD card and USB memory store information<br /><br />Battery<br /><br />~► Battery: Check the battery using record<br /><br />Application<br /><br />~► Install and uninstall the application<br /><br />PERSONAL<br /><br />Location<br /><br />~► Allow Access: Allowed application access to location information<br />~► GPS Positioning: Allow application access to your GPS position<br />~► Wi-Fi location Info: Allow Google services access for faster performance<br /><br />Security<br /><br />~► Screen lock<br />~► Owner Information<br />~► Require pin or password to access the device - Y / N<br />~► Display Password<br />~► Device Manager: Check or stop using the device manager<br />~► Unknown Source: Allow App installation from Unknown sources<br />~► Verified Apps: Application of banned installation maay cause damage, or warning before installation<br />~► Trusted credential: Display a trusted CA certificate<br />~► Install From SD: Install certificate from the SD card<br />~► Removed credential: Delete all certificates<br /><br />Language and Input Method:<br /><br />~► Language: Spell check tool, personal dictionary, keyboard and input method, a pointer speed<br /><br />Backup and Reset<br /><br />~► Backup Data: The application data, Wi-Fi passwords and other Settings are backed up to Google servers<br />~► Backup Account: Backup to the only debug private cache<br />~► Auto recovery: After installing an application, the system will restore backup settings and data<br />~► Restore and Factory Settings: Remove all the Data on the device.<br /><br />Account<br /><br />~► Add account<br /><br />Date and Time<br /><br />~► Auto Date & Time: Use the network time<br />~► Auto Time Zone: Automatically determine the time zone<br />~► Set Date: Set date<br />~► Set Time: Set time<br />~► Set Time Zone: Set time zone<br />~► Set Time Format: Set time format to 24H or 12H<br />~► Set Date Format: Set date format<br /><br />Other functions<br /><br />~► Talkback, Zoom gestures, large fonts, say the password, auxiliary function shortcut, touch and hold the delay, enhance web auxiliary functions<br /><br />Developer options<br /><br />Adjust CPU performance: Adjust the CPUT performance<br /><br />About device<br /><br />~► System upgrade, status messages, legal information, at the next boot startup guide, mode, Android version, baseband version, kernel version, the version member<br /><br />System Reset<br /><br />SocialMatic<br /><br />Sample provided for review."
Polaroid,Polaroid Socialmatic Instant Digital Camera (Black),20150201,B00QFVKXIC,5,2,6,"on February 1, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Lovely modern day polaroid!,"This camera is a great modern day Polaroid. Having incorporated with digital media technology, you now have an option to choose which photos to print. Saving money and the environment! Before buying this camera I already had an older version of this Polaroid camera listed here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GVXL1A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008GVXL1A&linkCode=as2&tag=newcams-20&linkId=5M2JTJJVYPB2AXXI<br /><br />After using this new updated Polaroid Socialmatic I can say that I’ve fallen in love again. It is obviously not the best digital camera around for the price as many reviews may critique. However, keep in mind the main focus of this camera is the ability to print on the go! While it lacks some things other digital cameras have (e.g. autofocus), it comes equipped with enough essential functions for a hobbyist to use it as an everyday camera.<br /><br />Software-wise there are also many reviews frowning upon this camera's out of date system. Aside from being unable to compete with common digital camera software, others complain that the pre-loaded frames for printing are lame and look prehistoric.<br /><br />But as I said I adore them! It is a Polaroid after all. Yes, it will not spit out the most glamorous prints but I feel like this is all a part of the Polaroid experience. It began a toy camera and made its fame. So why should not the tradition carry on after a few necessary upgrades? For those seeking quality prints, there always exists the option of taking your sd card to a proper print shop later on.<br /><br />Despite all the positive points, I do have a complaint about the hardware which is sturdily built (in my opinion). It is the size of traditional film cameras before digital cameras conquered the market. A little clumpy in order to accommodate the paper tray, but also adds to the vintage style. Which in turn, is a plus for me.<br /><br />I haven’t got a chance to try the video mode yet, but all in all a very pleasant package. Recommended to old school Polaroid enthusiasts looking for a modern touch, all young people who missed the Polaroid age, and all people who seeks instant printing!"

Polaroid,Polaroid Socialmatic Instant Digital Camera (Black),20150223,B00QFVKXIC,5,1,2,"on February 23, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Not Your Grandfather's Polaroid Camera!,"No, this POLAROID SOCIALMATIC 14MP WI-FI DIGITAL INSTANT PRINT & SHARE CAMERA is not your grandfather's Polaroid camera!  Yes, it can 'instantly' print a mini-snapshot (2' x 3') on glossy photo paper--but it does so much more, the real question is, 'What does this camera NOT do?' Basically, this camera is the equivalent of an Android tablet or smartphone, except that it's a point-and-shoot camera first, and a tablet second.<br /><br />*SETUP: When you open the box, there is no Quick Start manual--just a small sheet of paper saying to update the software before first use.  But the camera is incredibly intuitive to use.  You turn it on, wait for the touchscreen display to show the Setup Wizard, and follow the prompts for connecting to a wireless network, downloading and installing the Android update, connecting to a Google account (optional), and signing up with the Socialmatic network (optional).<br /><br />The camera battery has a partial charge that will carry you through the setup process and allow you to take (and print) a few photos without further charging.  A full charge takes about three hours; the instructions recommend against using the camera while it's charging.  The supplied charger comes with interchangeable plugs that any international traveler will appreciate.<br /><br />*DISPLAY:  When setup is complete, the display shows a familiar Android tablet/smartphone desktop that opens with a downward swipe.  To find the camera's instruction manual, you touch the Camera icon to open the Smart Access app, and touch the '?' at the top.  Alternatively, you can touch the Apps icon, and open the File Browser app to find the camera manual listed as a .pdf file.  The preloaded apps include a clock/calendar, calculator, Gmail, Google maps, Bluetooth, music player, browser, and other standard apps.  You can do everything with this camera that you can do with an Android smartphone or tablet.<br /><br />If you read the camera manual, you will learn, among other things, that you can use a USB host cable (e.g.,&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Micro-USB-Host-Cable/dp/B005GGBYJ4/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Micro USB Host Cable</a>) to connect a flash drive to view the drive's contents (or for additional photo storage).  There is also a slot for a Micro-SD card for additional photo storage.  The camera has 4 GB of built-in storage that can be expanded to 32 GB with a micro-SD card.  The manual advises that you should take the time to properly dismount any external storage drives to avoid damage to them.<br /><br />*CAMERA:  This is basically a point and shoot camera--there are few settings (other than exposure and picture size) that you can manually change.  You reach the settings that you can adjust by opening the Camera app (different from the Camera icon on the opening desktop). The Camera app includes 'Mode' settings that adjust for different kinds of ambient light (incandescent, fluorescent, daylight, cloudy), or that will set the camera to 'Auto' or 'Panorama'.<br /><br />I'm actually impressed by the quality of the photos that this camera took with the forward-facing camera set to 'Auto'.  They're perfectly focused (the camera does takes a second or so to focus and snap the shutter), and they're plenty sharp for sharing in emails, social media, and web forums.<br /><br />A test photo that I sent as an email attachment looked fine when opened with the Microsoft Office photo viewer at the default 20% that fit the entire photo to the viewer frame.  The photo displayed as slightly blurry when opened  in the viewer at 100%.  But the photo appeared as wonderfully sharp and detailed when printed by the camera as a mini-snapshot (2' x 3') on the included Zink photo paper.<br /><br />This camera has its own photo-editing software, in addition to printing capabilities, so it's a complete camera shop!<br /><br />There are two cameras, one front-facing (14 megapixel, autofocusing), one rear-facing (2 megapixel, fixed focus).  Touching a Camera app  button  switches the cameras back and forth.  A simple slider button changes the camera from shooting stills to shooting video footage.  The 'single-motion panorama' feature that creates panoramic photos is found in the 'Mode' settings.<br /><br />To take photos, you can use the physical shutter button on the camera case, or you can touch a shutter button on the touchscreen.  I find that using the touchscreen button helps me to hold the camera steady when I'm taking a photo.<br /><br />*TOUCHSCREEN:  The display for the Android desktop and for the photos is vivid and seems to be fairly high definition.  However, the touchscreen is not as accurate as I would like it to be.  I had trouble making the zoom-in/zoom-out gestures work consistently, and inadvertently changed a lot of pages while trying to zoom.  This is a minor annoyance.  All of the camera settings, navigation features, and buttons are easy to use.<br /><br />*PRINTING:  Unlike your grandfather's Polaroid camera, this camera does NOT print all photos and waste lots of expensive photo paper on bad shots.  Instead, it takes and stores digital photos and only prints the ones you ask it to print.<br /><br />To print photos, you load photo paper into the camera body, which is very easy--a latch opens up the entire hinged back of the case, and there are paper loading instructions printed inside.  Then you print your selected photo by touching the Camera icon to bring up the SmartAccess menu, selecting the Printer menu, and hitting the little Print icon.<br /><br />There is a packet of 10 Zink photo papers included in the box.  You can buy more photo paper from Amazon (e.g.,&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Polaroid-M230-Premium-2-x-3-Zink-Paper-50-Pack/dp/B008GVVUFE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Polaroid M230 Premium 2 x 3' Zink Paper (50 Pack)</a>).  Photo paper currently costs about $25 for 50 sheets.<br /><br />*CONCLUSION: As an incorrigible gadget lover, I'm blown away by all the features of this modern Polaroid camera.  I love being able to print mini-snapshots, love the built-in photo editor, and love being able to send photos directly from the camera as email attachments or as uploads to social media (e.g., Facebook, Socialmatic).  However, it's not a camera for a serious photographer--it's a fun family camera, and at approximately $300, it's a rather expensive toy.  Unless you want or need the instant snapshot printing feature, you probably want to shop around for a different camera, or to get by with your smartphone or tablet camera.<br /><br />Disclaimer note:  This review is based on a product supplied to me by the manufacturer free of charge for review purposes.

The instant inkless printing is great for sharing with people around you immediately, and the amazing online sharing and editing capabilities mean that you are able to share immediately through social media. The best part is the QR code embedding which makes it great if you keep a professional instagram account or twitter account, since you can post and track the photo. The touch screen also makes it really easy to use, and the adhesive back to the pictures makes it great for kids who want to decorate their room or for scrap booking."

Polaroid,Polaroid Socialmatic Instant Digital Camera (Black),20150219,B00QFVKXIC,2,0,0,"on February 19, 2015",ANONYMOUS,"Interesting, but not terribly practical and could be improved","Up front I received this as a review sample and as much as I would love to love it, I just do not. Here are a few reasons why, which I will get out of the way first so I can end this review on a more positive note. However, first I am going to try to describe what this is: an Android tablet in a camera form factor.<br /><br />Foremost among the reasons why I subtracted stars is the instructions do not begin to scratch the surface. Even the quick start instructions did not disclose any illustration details of the buttons and ports. In fact, there were no details about inserting the paper for prints or even specs like charging times and how much use you can expect on a full charge. For an experienced Android phone and tablet user some of the missing information is a mere inconvenience. For someone accustomed to IOS or other types of phones and tablets the learning curve can be daunting.<br /><br />Second, since this is a full blown tablet the screen should have been larger in relation to the overall form factor. Instead the printing mechanism takes up real estate that would be better suited to allocating to the screen. Indeed, the mere fact that this has a printer at all is a head scratcher  for me because the near seamless connectivity to remote printing that this device's software allows obviates the need for on the spot printing. In this day and age photos are mainly shared in digital form with only occasional need for hard copies. Especially when thirty prints from a pack of Zero-Ink paper runs about fifteen bucks at the time of this review - see&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Polaroid-2x3-Premium-ZINK-Zero-Ink-Paper-30-Pack/dp/B008GVVTPU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Polaroid 2x3' Premium ZINK Zero Ink Paper 30-Pack</a>.<br /><br />Since this is camera-centric the lack of a 1/4-20 threaded mount for tripods is a glaring omission and yet another reason why I subtracted two stars.<br /><br />THE GOOD: this is a full fledged Android computer that is a breeze to set up and configure. I had that part up and operational in less than five minutes. Do bear in mind that not only am I a retired IT professional, but have extensive Android experience, so for folks like myself the dearth of documentation is not an issue. Even a novice user can follow the basic set-up instructions, which allow you to skip steps and come back later.<br /><br />Although the screen is not as large as I would have liked, it is more than sufficient for most tasks and is a lot larger than my Galaxy Note 3 phone's screen.<br /><br />The computing part is relatively fast too. I was able to browse web sites at brisk speeds, and uploading photos to facebook was as fast as from my Note 3 phone or my Samsung Tab 3 10.1 tablet - both of which are fairly quick.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: unless you absolutely need the ability to print 3x2 inch photos you would probably be better off with a small tablet, which makes more sense and does everything else that this camera does (except the hard copy prints.) Of course, if you need hard copy prints and 3x2 inch ones are adequate, this may be just what you need."

It arrived very promptly.  Easy to set up, etc.  Took one picture; turned out fine.  Fast forward three weeks.  My two granddaughters were visiting and I knew they had never seen a Polaroid.  The stupid thing wouldn't work! Nothing happened!  We installed new batteries, still did not work.  Afterwards, I went back online to check out more of the customer reviews.  Lots of them were positive (those are the ones I read before I ordered it), however, there were a few that were totally negative.  I would certainly add my name to that list.  I also have three rolls of useless film.  In fact, I am today mailing it back to a Polaroid address I found on their website.  They probably can't fix it, but I want them to know they have a very poor product out in the marketplace with their name on it."

I immediately opened it with care, read the instructions, and loaded the film. Then I tried to load the batteries.

Since I had used the batteries that came with the product, and included batteries are usually subpar, I thought nothing of it and went out to buy namebrand batteries. In spite of this effort, the camera still does not work. It flashes the low battery lights, no matter what brand of newly-purchased batteries I load it with. I looked my issue up, and apparently, this defect is fairly common and there is no known solution.

So my review is not about ONE camera, it is about all four. No chance we just got a lemon. They're all lemons. The picture it takes is not what you are looking at through the viewer. It takes a picture of what is next to what you are looking at through the viewer. It would be funny except it isn't, it's extremely annoying. You can't center anything to save your life. We compensate by just aiming the lens at the object being photographed and we don't even look through the viewer. The color/picture quality are horrible. The button is on the front, instead of top, so your finger blocks the flash, or the viewer (see how close they are together in the picture). This camera is of a quality suitable for a five year old, not adults, not for work, not for any photography you might actually want to turn out decent."

Firstly, I loved the fact that it's all in one camera, with the printer so I can carry it anywhere and instantly print out photos that I've shot at the spot. But it's a bit bulky and heavy to be really carrying around for long distance trips. Photo quality was okay, but you might want to reconsider buying if looking for professional quality photos. But it's a fun instant printing digital camera and also very convenient to use. Easy to navigate menu options and the excitement of watching the photo printing right out of the camera instantly is definitely worth it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

Although it's not a true 'polaroid' camera in the traditional sense, I love that it's digital and you can choose which photos you want to print, deleting the rest.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars because they only give you 10 3x2 photo sheets.

When I re ordered the &#34;sticky paper&#34; that goes with it I did not receive the same paper that came with the original camera. The biggest feature that I was looking for in a journaling camera was sticker photos. And I'm having a hell of a time trying to find the ORIGINAL paper that came with this camera. The one that is sold by Polaroid here on amazon (50 pack) IS NOT BY POLAROID! You will know this from opening the package and not finding the Zink logo on the back of the paper. Instead it will have a blue tint to it AND IT IS NOT STICKY!<br /><br />So while I absolutely love the camera and the 10 sheets of paper it originally came with, I am ABSOLUTELY NOT IMPRESSED that It's impossible to re order the ORIGINAL sticky paper that came with the camera.<br /><br />Even going to the polaroid website and clicking on the 30 pack brings you to the Amazon listing for the 50 pack of fake Non-sticky stuff that I am not stuck with.

That wasn't a problem for me.  It's fine if I just bring it out once in a while, but it's not something I would have just laying in my hand bag.  It takes pretty decent pictures with the correct film, but my problem with the camera is that the picture you take is not a 2x3 photo, but the film is 2x3, which means when you print your picture, parts get cut off.  This was something NO ONE has mentioned or noticed (I guess).  The other thing is that this camera has frames for pictures you have taken.  I thought it was pretty cool and loved it! I thought the frames were kind of cute...but it was not cool when I printed the pictures out.  You first need to take a picture, then you can add a frame.  The problem with this is that you can't tell what's going to get covered up by the frames.  I wasn't able to readjust the picture to make everything fit.  Some reviewers mentioned that your photo will just get smaller to fit into the frame, which is NOT true.  Then when you print out the photo, the frames get cut off because they are not within the 2x3 size.  the picture you take and the picture you print out are not the same size. I feel that this is very deceiving to the customer.  If you are going to digitize something, make sure it works when you are printing both from the camera and computer.  I wasted film because I was trying to figure out if it was just me or the camera.  If Polaroid can fix this so what you see on the camera screen is the same as what will be printed out (with the frame) , then I would definitely buy this camera again, but for now, I think I'd just rather return the camera and get my money back.  I really like that it's a digital camera and I was fighting with myself about whether or not to return it, but I think I have to return the camera if it's not meeting all of my standards for it.  If the camera is supposed to print out 2x3 photos, then they should make the screen 2x3, so that the whole picture fits and there should be an option to shrink the image to fit the whole picture into the frame.  There is an option to shrink the photo, but that's only when you make a collage...so sad, but I will have to return this camera.  I really do like it a lot and I hope polaroid can fix these things so that I can print out photos with cute frames straight from the camera.  Currently, the photos I took are of family and I don't want to post those on the internet, so I'll add a photo to show you what I'm talking about in the near future, before I return the camera."

So fun for printing novelty pics/stickers!,"For many of us geezers, old school Polaroid Cameras were the only way for INSTANT pictures...well as close to instant as it came!  Digital cameras and our phones have given us the convenience of taking pictures and then printing them when we get to a printer, but that &#34;in the moment&#34; shared paper copy novelty is still not there. The Polaroid Z2300 Instant Digital Camera is a fun blend of Digital Camera, so you can CHOOSE (and even edit a bit) the picture you want to print AND Printer!  As with the old school Polaroid Cameras, these prints are not mean to be high quality frame-able images, but rather novelty memories for you to share and maybe wear (since the prints are also stickers).<br /><br />The camera itself has a &#34;plastic&#34; feel that was disappointing at first.  I'm a little more open to it now because my teenager pointed out that Polaroid was probably going for a retro feel and look and she is probably right.  It certainly reminded me of the old Polaroid cameras and the big &#34;red&#34; button went from being more comical to nostalgic.<br /><br />Unfortunately my screen came with little scratches on it but I can't get a photo that shows the scratches really because they are so small and fine.  I chalked it up to the plastic construction.  It wasn't hard to load the photo film, it goes just behind the screen.  The batter and SD card load in the same spot on the bottom of the camera and I plan to add more photos and/or a video soon...(I prefer to use my Tablet and Amazon doesn't let us load videos from it yet)<br /><br />The print feature is what this camera is all about and I'm really impressed with it!  As I expected, the picture is about the size of a business card or wallet photo  and there is no ink required because of the special paper.  I expected it to print in about 15 seconds but it takes longer than that, about 30-35 seconds.  Printing does drain the battery fast so you'll need to be aware of that if you are printing mementos throughout the day.  I can definitely see this as a fun gift for a college student or teenager as the prints are cute and instant...I do like the capacity of 32 gb on a SD card if you choose to buy one (I think it's a must).<br /><br />The Good:<br />The quick business size picture (absolutely no fading and surprisingly clear pics)<br />  *Note: keep the mp size down on the pictures or you won't be able to print them<br />The size (I liked having a camera that was a little more substantial to hold)<br />Ease of use (took me a few minutes to figure out how to print and add borders but it is intuitive)<br />Being able to save to an SD card so you can transfer pics fast to computer<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The plastic quality<br />The weight (Because of the integrated printer, it feels a little heavier than you expect at first)<br />The battery life (when printing)<br />The digital zoom (makes for some blurry pics)<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's fun and my teen daughter loves it.  We love the idea of using them on each table at wedding receptions and having guests take pictures of themselves because they get the novelty printed picture and the bride & groom get SD cards full of fun candid shots of their guests.  We have loved using the camera and have used it a lot more than we expected!  Our kids' birthday parties will be the next planned use because all of their playmates have LOVED getting quick little pictures to take home after play dates at the park and childrens' museum.<br /><br />We received this camera at a discount for our honest and unbiased review."

Also, the prints came out rather blurry and very dark with a strong blue-ish tint (but this may have been due to the zink paper that we purchased and promptly returned both). We are now looking for a good portable printer that actually has ink cartridges instead of the zink paper because it fits more what we are looking for."

One of my favorite ones is the macro setting for close-up shots. I love the fact that it takes great pictures with a quick snapshot relay. It can at times take a little bit for it to auto-focus on what you're taking a picture of, but it's not too bad.

NOW don't get me wrong it is way smaller than the actually Polaroid cameras from my generation! I jumped on the opportunity to review this product because my 12 year old daughter has been begging for a actual polaroid to instantly print photos. Although the size is very off-putting the camera itself was perfect for what I needed it for. Not only can you print from the actual camera but having the ability to expand the memory was awesome especially considering you are able to take video with the camera also.<br />My daughter was pleased with it, but had it been my camera I would not have rated it quite so high. The quality in which it prints leave a lot to be desired, you have to be careful when printing some pictures because of the error code you get. The pictures tend to fade quickly so the quality there could be improved! My daughter loved the fact the pictures were also stickers. The paper can get expensive if you want to print a lot...and if you print a lot you will notice that your battery will die quite quickly.<br />I like that it came with adapters for other countries, we tend to take the kids on one big family vacation a year, last year it was Germany and this year it will be the Dominican so those adapter will come in handy because I know my daughter will want to bring the camera.<br />I was given a discount on this item for a honest unbiased review...I was not forced to write a positive review!"

This takes the difficulty and time out of printing your pictures.  It comes with a rechargeable battery. This is super handy so I'm not constantly looking for batteries!<br />After charging it, the power button is on top. Once on, it prompts you to set your camera up (language, date, etc). The screen is not touch screen, but the buttons are very easy to navigate.  This also comes with 10 sheets of picture paper to get you started. I recommend purchasing more as you will go through these quicker than you would believe! It super easy to refill the paper as the flap opens in the back, where the screen is.  There is also a slot for a memory card where the battery is.  I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinions because I love to take pictures!  This camera is a little bulky, but its understandable.  The pictures come out clear and there are several editing features. This camera is great for anyone from young kids to adults.

I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for a review. This product looks beautiful. The block shape fits into my purse way better than the old models. It is however really bulky because of the built in printer. I don't recommend getting the white one if you're anal about your merchandise staying absolutely clean. I bought the white one and you can see dusts on it easily.<br /><br />I'm still playing around with this camera. So far, I really like the passport photo feature. You know how you go to a place to get your passport photo taken, only to be stuck with a picture you don't like? Well I helped my cousins take many pictures until they finally settle with one. Remember: This Polaroid camera DOES NOT PRINT automatically. You get to pick your favorite pictures that you want to print.<br /><br />Till this day, I still love to print my photos and write/ draw things on the back. My Polaroid lets me print on the spot for those precious moments when I meet someone for the first and maybe last time/ long time.<br /><br />Printing takes around a minute or 2 so, and it doesn't come with those vintage borders.

Of course the quality of the pic is not perfect for it isnt' HD but the videos I took on my vacaction were HD, not sure why they designed the Polaroid to only take HD videos but I knew this when I got it. The camera was so easy for me to set up, installing the battery and paper was so simple and the wrist band for carrying. I liked how when I went to charge the camera I was given three different plug outlets so if I was to travel abround I would be set for any outlet. The meun was easy to set up and to understand. I will have to get a SD card for it doesnt how enough memory for me. It is a nice looking and well designed camera that took enough good quality pictures of my vacation so Iam pleased with it. Oh yes fyi it was 10 mega pixels! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."

I do some professional photography and this was to be a fun toy for my kids. I didn't expect perfection but I also didn't want to cringe every time I looked at the photos. The photo prints came out grainy, dark and blue. I tried photos both indoors and outdoors with the same result. I even brightened with the editing on the camera beforehand.  I wasn't expecting it to look as good as my dslr prints or even as my iphone prints, but I did hope it would look similar to my 80s polaroid prints. But it doesn't. It looks like I printed out a crappy digital photo on crappy printer paper. I don't even have a photo printer and I can print a better copy on regular paper from my printer.  I was eager to fiddle with the settings in manual......., but they seem non existant. Also it says the prints are waterproof , but its not. If you get a tiny bit of water on it , it will lighten that part of the print.  We will be returning this and trying a Fuji film."

It is definitely only for journals or keeping a record. What it is perfect for is to get prints that we can hang on the fridge! This is too small for anything else. We used it during a small party at home and we exhausted 8/10 papers that it came with.

Since there have been quite a few reviews already posted, here are just a few thoughts based on my experience to date.<br /><br />CAMERA BUILD:  It feels like an inexpensive camera, perhaps because it is one.  It has been described as bulky.  My response would be 'Compared to which other cameras that print pictures?&#34; I am impressed at its size versus what it can do.  I concur with input from other buyers that the door to the printer paper pops open too easily.  Likewise, I find the camera sometimes turns on when I am just putting it in the case.  I find these minor annoyances.<br /><br />EXTRA BATTERY:  I got an extra battery.  Contrary to what was written in a prior review, I have not had to reset the date & time when swapping batteries at an unhurried pace.  I am not challenging the prior review, but rather speculating that there is a limited window of time in which the swap can be done without loosing that date/time data.<br /><br />POLAROID CASE:  A complete waste of money.  I subsequently ordered a Case Logic CPL102.  Camera plus two packs of paper and spare battery all fit in it.  It comes with both a belt loop and over-the-shoulder strap.<br /><br />PRINTS:  I have taken about 75-100 pictures so far and printed out about 15. In keeping with every Polaroid camera that I have ever had, the picture is more about instant gratification than image quality.  That said, I have found the image quality quite good.  The picture is certainly not what I can do using a high-end printer for an image pulled from the SD chip and run through Lightroom, but it is respectable.  The biggest problem I have with the prints is that they are a mite small.  To make them look bigger, I have cut up some stiff paper into 4.25&#34; x 3&#34; pieces on which (using Excel) I had faintly printed a centered rectangle just under 3&#34;x2&#34;.  I peal off the adhesive back off a Zink print, mount it on the paper using the faint lines to position it and presto, it is a framed picture that look larger.<br /><br />PRINTING PICTURES TAKEN ON OTHER CAMERAS:  Let me preface the following by saying that I have only tried this with one camera - a Canon S120 shooting hi-res RAW in3:2 format.  I took the 32GB chip out of that camera and put it in the Polaroid.  I could see the pictures taken with the Canon.  I tried to print one.  It worked.  Again, this was a highly limited experiment from which I am not prepared to make any generalized statement about the ability in print pictures taken by other cameras."
Polaroid,Polaroid Z2300 10MP Digital Instant Print Camera (Purple),20150829,B00MG2WYSG,5,0,0,"on August 29, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Nostalgic,"I honestly didn't even know that up to date Polaroids were a thing until I came across this camera, and I am so incredibly happy with it! It's awesome! It brings back memories of being a child and using the old school polaroids. The camera itself takes very good quality digital pictures, and even has expandable memory. It prints directly from the camera via special paper you insert inside of it, and that has to be my favorite thing about this product. Getting an instant print out of a memory I want to always remember, what's better than that?? The camera is super portable and comes with a wrist strap so you can take it anywhere you go. While it is bulkier than most digital cameras today, that's only because it houses paper and honestly the trade off isn't even a question in my mind. We recently used this for my daughters 5th birthday party and set up a small area with little props and a backdrop. Her guests and their parents were able to take fun, cute pictures and have an instant printout. It was a HUGE hit at her party with all the adults, and I know of two that actually went and purchased the camera from Amazon after having used it at my home.

When I was first offered a chance to receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, I was hesitant, because I honestly had looked at these and decided against them because of remembering how my pictures would smear on the old versions, as well as the paper cost. So , this arrived, and so did my excitement because right away, the fact that it was much lighter than I had expected and that it was more modern that what It seemed, I was starting to be impressed.<br /><br />Now for the true test. Setting the camera up was not that hard, I think even those with limited Tech experience can figure this one out . Loading the paper to print when the time came was the trickiest  part of the whole set up process and even I figured that out after just a couple of minutes. Once you assure that the Camera is charged, you have it set up and your paper is loaded and you have tested it, it's time to take your first photo-book quality picture.<br /><br />You take pictures on this just as you normally would and you have the option to print them right away, so now you can give a hard copy to Aunt Mable & Uncle Johnny and you don't have to rush off to the drug store to print them or send in to an online service for prints either. The downside is that Aunt Mable may need her glasses on to see it because the pictures are really small. Never fear though, you can always get larger copies made to send her at a later date, but in the meantime you have a cool camera that takes instant pictures that even Aunt Mable will remember the ones that she had that would do that ( Which she may still have)<br /><br />The overall quality of the pictures is actually really good. The Pixels themselves are very impressive for what you would expect from an instant camera photo. I can honestly say that these come out looking just as good as some digital pictures I have taken with high resolution and higher Megapixels.<br /><br />My daughters have now used this a few times on outings with friends for the end of summer fun, and several Mom's have all called me to ask about this camera now, and I can genuinely say that I love it and never leave home without this or my Polaroid pocket printer.<br /><br />The camera does come with everything you need to get started, including a starter pack of paper to print your photo's with. The instruction booklet is very detailed with precise instructions. It is very easy to get set up and get started using it. You get some great pictures , and you can now make Aunt Mable happy on the spot ( Well, about pictures anyway)<br /><br />I can give this an easy 5 stars. I have been using this for a few weeks now and have not had even the slightest issue with this Camera. It fits in my purse easily and I have found that most any camera case works for this except , of course the ones made for the small micro camera's. The paper is not half as expensive as I originally thought and you can buy it in larger packs to save even more. This would be an excellent gift for a teenager who has everything, including a smartphone, because remember when...we had the Polaroids and we loved them, well even my teenagers love this as well and they have Digital Camera's, Smartphones and tablets.<br /><br />Would I recommend this: Yes, without a doubt and i am just sorry that I waited so long to get this one."

It takes mediocre pictures,"Let's start with the build quality: it's massive compared to digital cameras today, and feels very light for its size.  It's made almost entirely of plastic, and just kind of feels cheap and poor quality.<br /><br />It takes mediocre pictures, well below the current expectations from a point and click camera, especially one at this price point.  Obviously, this phone's primary gimmick is its in-built printer, but at this price the camera should have a better sensor, at least some form of optical zoom, and a MUCH better screen--the preview screen is horribly low-res, slow, and not touch screen like the standard is these days.  As a camera, this is all around disappointing.<br /><br />The printer is pretty cool, I must say.  I don't know if I'll ever buy a refill for this, or if I'll ever even use it for anything again, but it has its uses.  You can be your very own photobooth, and take and print low, but good enough, quality pictures for your fridge or wallet.<br /><br />At this price point, I would never have bought this camera.  Honestly, this is pretty much dead technology.  This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."

My 2-year-old thought it was so cool to print the picture I took of him.

It takes pictures quickly, and has many options to edit the photos. I can change the color depth, and add frames I really like this option. The photos printed are not perfect quality, but are great for being an instant print. I have had no problems with the camera so far. It is a bit bulky but it is expected for a polaroid. I would also suggest purchasing an sd card to take large amounts of photos. As the camera only allows a few to be taken. The camera charges quickly, and holds the charge for long amounts of time.

This camera produces fairly small photos (2&#34; x 3&#34;) and while they don't have the familiar white border which I really like about Polaroid pics, the bonus is that the pictures have sticky backs. This could be really fun for kids and also useful for school projects. I think it could be great for any special event where having an instant photo from the event would be a special treat, like at weddings, birthday parties, etc.<br /><br />The camera is larger and heavier than I expected, but then when I think about the fact that it has the printer inside of it, it seems to be a reasonable size and weight. As a consumer, I have been trained to expect my electronics to be very compact.<br /><br />While the above may seem like negative reviews, my overall feeling is I like this camera. It is fun! It is also great because you don't have to print every photo you take and you get the previewing abilities of a digital camera.<br /><br />I received this camera for a reduced price in exchange for my honest review."

Purchasing this camera reminds me of my grandma, who every now and then just has to pull out her old Polaroid camera and will not upgrade to digital. I think it is awesome that you can select which images to print out, instead of every picture you take, it automatically prints out. In order to print, just push the double sqaure button and it will ask you if you want to print and how many copies. This camera comes with 10 photo sheets for you to load into the camera, which I found it VERY easy to do. All you need to do is open the door and place the sheets in the camera. It does need to eject the sheet card before you can print. When it comes to printing the photos, it does not really take long at all, but the pictures do come out tiny, I love it! I think it is such a fun way to take pictures and be able to carry them around with you in your wallet without having to fold the picture. In my opinion, the picture printed out pretty clear, I was actually kind of surprised on the quality.<br /><br />When it comes to the quality of the pictures overall, that is where I am not sure on this camera. The camera does take decent pictures, don't get me wrong. Just compared to my Nikon digital camera, the images are not as clear. I think for me, this would make a great vacation camera, when I do not want to chance my other camera getting damaged. Also, this one would be a lot easier to carry in a camera case or purse than my current one.<br /><br />Another plus that I like, you charge this camera with an AC adapter, no having to carry batteries around and hoping they are alive enough to last you until you are done using the camera. At the same time, just make sure you remember to plug the camera in the night before.<br /><br />I found viewing the photos to my laptop to be extremely easy to do. Just plug the camera in, go to the removable disc drive, select the folders, and my pictures were there. Of course, my computer gave me other options to view the pictures, but I found this the easiest for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this camera. While it could use a little better quality when taking photos, they do come out decent, you have a fun little printer at hand, and the camera seems to be made well.<br /><br />I received this camera at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion"

I was around 10 and the fact that you could have an instant photo was beyond my simple little mind, but I really enjoyed it. I didn't even realize that they made a more modern camera until I randomly found this clicking through my emails. Seriously? It was a must by that very instant, after I told the husband of course! Based on the color options and what I received I would state that the colors are pretty spot on to point and they all look so vibrant. It really was a hard pick.<br /><br />Based on the size of the printer within the camera it reminds me of the size of digital camera when they first came out. At least with this camera it's extremely understandable of why it's so bulky but not too bulky that it's hard to handle, whether taking pictures or printing. You have the basic options on this camera as you would with your standard digital camera. It's a 10 megapixel camera, which is actually a downgrade to most smartphones out - they're at 13 megapixels. Most digital cameras that you would find within this price range will vary from 16 to 20 megapixels. That's the only downfall that I could find but with all that it needs to do, it's understandable why it's a little behind with the megapixels.<br /><br />It comes with everything that you need to start up and use the camera and printer right away. Upon getting it you actually have charge within the camera to play around with it but I wouldn't recommend using it full blown until it has had a nice lengthy charge. (Wouldn't want it dying on you mid print. Yikes!) You can take your pictures as you would with any other digital camera and store it onto a memory card, which it does not come with, and/or take the pictures off your camera by plugging the camera into your computer, using the cord that it came with, and transfer them onto your computer - very easy to do.<br /><br />It comes with a pack of ZINK paper, 10 count. Make sure you keep the Smartsheet, that is on the bottom of the stack of picture paper, in the stack and place that on the bottom when loading your camera. You could take that paper out of the stack when loading the paper, it works either way. If you go to print a picture and you don't have paper in it, it will notify you but only after it acts like it has printed the picture -- so you'll have to sit through two 'prints' to get the one, but only you load the paper. When you go to print the picture you'll see a number dialog pop up so you can select how many copies that you want verse having to print them each individually. I didn't realize that and I started printing and I had it on 8 but was able to cancel after I ended up with two. So just an FYI there.<br /><br />You also get the adapter to plug the camera into the wall. The adapter you have 4 attachments to choose from for which one you're able to use. So if you were to take this out of country or buy it, being in another country, you can rest assure that you'll be able to plug up and charge your camera, regardless. It's a tad tough to get the attachment off but that's not the end of the world. Reason being is it's reassuring that it's just going going to fall off or get loose and not make a connection and once you get the one on that you'll need you won't have to take it off unless you were to change locations, as in countries.<br /><br />This is a great camera that will give you great prints in a 2x3' in about 30 seconds. The time in printing the picture will vary in the contents of the picture and what all needs to be placed onto the picture. Scrap booking, Christmas cards, random pictures to friends and family - you could use this camera and photos for anything and everything. Also, being that the picture is able to stick, by peeling off the backing of the photo, makes this that much more open for what to do with the pictures. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my unbiased review. My opinion was not influenced by the discount that I received."

The video isn't the best either.  The instant prints are fun and a cool way to preserve memories, but the lack of quality even shows in these prints.  The camera feels somewhat cheaply built also.  I would say this is a fun camera to mess around with, but for the price it sells for I would expect a little more."

The camera has all the features of a point and shoot digital camera...I haven't played around with it, but there is even image stabilization. You can zoom, you can record video at 720p, you can add an SD card to store your photos...but the fun part comes when you are able to instantly print out the pictures you like the best.<br /><br />The printer (right in the camera) prints out little 2&#34;x3&#34; photos (which can also become stickers if you peel off the backing. There is no ink...yes, inkless printing! There are fun little frames you can add to the photos too. I was pretty impressed with the speed and print quality.

The paper is a little pricey (you pay about .50 for a picture - buy it on Amazon in bulk), but considering you can CHOOSE which picture to print (which was never the case with the original Polaroid cameras), and there are not ink cartridges to replace, the price is pretty fair.<br /><br />If you want a fun camera that lets you print out cute pictures instantly, I would recommend this camera. It's not for those wanting professional type photographers. This would be an amazing thing to use at parties, weddings (guests take pics of themselves?), classrooms (pictures of the kiddos on mother day cards, etc), or even around the house - making chore charts or visual boards for kids. So many options! I think teens would really love this camera as well - I know mine do!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review"

I recommend using a memory card since it will only store a few photos. It took decent photos. When printing them many of the pictures had color that was a little off to a line all the way through the top. I do not know id that was because the film was bad or the camera printer. When i think about Polaroid photos they were not always the clearest so I did not have high expectations. It is a fun camera and conversational piece. photos are a small size that is cute.

There were more features for editing and taking pictures than I expected. But while the appearance and features of this camera are great, there are a few things that have room for improvement. The major problem I had is that it is designed so that the picture prints out of the right side, where you hold for the shutter. You have to switch hands or sit the camera down in order to not cause damage to the photo. It would have benefitted greatly from printing out the left where it had no real interference with hands. The second thing is that the pictures aren't good quality. It would be okay for scrapbooking or a child but even then it's a little steeply priced, in my opinion."

It has 10 megapixels and a 3 inch LCD screen. First you should charge the camera, there is a battery you need to insert into it then you can plug the camera in and charge. You also need to insert the paper with the blue sheet down. After the camera is charged you can take pictures, the camera has a small internal memory or you can insert a memory card. There is a cd to download software to your computer and a cord to plug the camera into a computer. To print a picture (2&#34;x3&#34;) you select picture and push printer button. The picture prints in seconds and is good quality for an ink less printer! Only downside I had for this camera is the size, its larger than I thought and not that convenient to carry around. It takes up a lot of space in my purse. But overall I would recommend! (I received this at a discount for my honest review)"

I just knew she would love it and boy was I right. There were so many cool features that makes it perfect for her such as the small size. You would expect the  camera to be somewhat bulky since it has a built in printer right, Wrong the camera is compact and great for easy portability. This is great for her because she can easily put it into her bookbag and take it with her. Because every teen has to be up with the latest technology, touchscreen has because an absolute must  this camera fits the bill for that as well. I like that unlike old school cameras she can take pictures and then choose what to print rather than wasting prints on a picture that isn't all that great. I didn't find too much that I didn't like in this camera. The major thing is picture quality isn't the absolute greatest but its not horrible either, it works great  for a teen who wants to print out pictures of her friends. Other than that the only problem I have found is not finding the paper around here in stores you can order it off of here  but it is quite affordable, so not a complete problem. Overall I am happy that she is so happy with her camera. I am happy to have gotten it at a discount to be able to try out and give an honest review on.

One lesson we learned was to make sure the corner that we attached a handle to (a floating camera strap, btw) was on the bottom right (I'm right-handed). If you set it up with the strap in the wrong spot, you'll have a heck of a time staying out of your own way!<br /><br />The pictures we took were clear, but since we were underwater they were blue-heavy, to be expected and some photoshop work will fix that.

There are three points that made this waterproof case less than perfect (one of which is my camera's fault) and cumulatively cost it only one star.<br /><br />1. Since this is a one-size-fits-lots kind of case, it comes with two foam blocks to act as shims in order to keep a camera stationary inside. I ended up stuffing rubber bumpers I found laying around the house in the sides and behind in addition to the foam blocks.<br /><br />2. No matter how I positioned the flash bulb in the case, it always left some sort of whited-out section in the picture.  No photos in the grottoes of Atlantis! Bummer.<br /><br />3. Had to set a zoom level and leave it there.  My camera zoom is accomplished by a little finger trigger swung left or right.  If your camera has buttons for T and W then you're set, but alas I am not.  YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE ANY FUNCTIONS OF YOUR CAMERA THAT REQUIRE FLIPPING A SWITCH OR TRIGGER TO SELECT.  Anything that requires a simple push of a button is a Go."

My Canon Powershot ELPH 100HS and my Canon Powershot SD1400 were too small for this BIG Polaroid Housing Device.

The one drawback was that the box will only allow for the pressing of buttons on the camera. For the most part that is all you do. On the EasyShare cameras they have a knob to twist... impossible in this box. But don't let that disuade you from buying this product. Take the advice from Ron Popeil - 'just set it and forget it!'.

I looked up the Canon underwater housing...over $200, couldn't justify that purchase for a couple days of snorkeling. Saw this one, was super cheap, seemed to have good reviews so gave it a shot with my Canon SD790IS. The fit was good. Stayed in place. Taking shots with the flash is pretty much useless as the flash beams off the inside. The pictures turned out ok, not overly impressed with them, but for memory sake not bad. If you are looking for pictures you can hang on a wall you should spend the money and get the canon housing. Pushing the shutter button was easy, but changing settings once in the Polaroid case was taxing and difficult or impossible. Overall, if you are looking to experiment with your camera underwater this case is perfect, but it won't get you any type of award winning shots. give it a try!"

Tested it with the camera inside to see if I could use the buttons with ease - indeed you can!<br />3. I have a DSC-WX150 Sony camera and it fits just fine in the housing and room to run - they do provide stuffing to help the movement of your camera. All in all for the price its a good fit for the camera and the money you spent.<br />Con's: One can't expect to get much for the price, how long it will last - dunno!

We decided to wait for the next generation/model year and thought this to be a good option until we find and buy a WP camera.  On our recent cruise to the Caribbean we put our old Casio EX-Z1050 compact into it for snorkeling at two beaches.  There was no leakage.  Photos and videos were 'good'.  Ability to change settings was fairly difficult but possible.  I did not attempt to use the flash to check for flash-back.  In many conditions while snorkeling it is EXTREMELY difficult to see the LCD screen so it was 'point and pray' but it worked pretty well.  This was a reasonable option, given the price, and performed well in it's role.  I recommend this item as a temporary use measure.

People either loved it, or thought it was a piece of junk.  I figured for $20 if I use it and it doesn't work, I'll just send it back.  The case is easy to put together, tightly locks in place, and has specific instructions for testing it to ensure that there is a water tight seal.  They even provide you with optional foam wedges to place around your camera so that it fits as snug as possible while inside the case.  I used this case (and the foam bumpers) for my cannon powershot and I have to say we got some GREAT photos both underwater and above water.  There were never any leaks, the inside of the case didn't fog, and the plastic stayed clean so you didn't have to worry about your camera focusing on the smudges.<br />Word of advice, try not to get sunscreen on the plastic that fits over the lens.  The one issue I ended up having was after taking pictures under water or getting the case wet, beads of water remained on the plastic.  Instead of my camera focusing on the background, it focused on the beads of water on the plastic in front of the lens.  This only took a few minutes to dissipate and then the pictures came out just fine again.  I blamed it on my waterproof sunscreen that I had inadvertently gotten on this part of the case.  Being careful to avoid this in the future, I didn't experience this problem again."

Based on other reviews I knew it needed to be zoomed in all the way for the lense to be closest to the plastic for better picture.  The problem is that the zoom on my camera is at the top and you have to push the little lever left or right to zoom in and out versus some cameras you just push a button to zoom in or out.  I could not do this while in the case.  the clear part is flexible enough to push all other buttons on the camera but not enough to do the zoom.  The reason I found this to be an issue is b/c I would have to open the housing everytime I wanted to use it so I could zoom in and then close it.  I wanted to be able to keep it in the case and use it on an off without opening it.  For this reason i'm returning it and purchasing a waterproof camera.  For camera's with button zoom I think it could be a great cheap alternative to buying a waterproof camera."

The camera fits nicely inside the case, and when we took it out into the water, it did it's job. The camera stayed dry and protected, and taking pictures was easy. That was until we got to about 25 feet while diving. Because of the water pressure, the camera case started to collapse inward, specifically around the empty space were the lens is. We dove down to 60 feet of water, and were not able to use the camera. It would not turn on or zoom in or out because the case was preventing the lens from coming out. Also, around 30 feet, the camera started taking pictures by itself because the case was squeezing in on the buttons. Overall, the camera is great for snorkeling and shallow water diving, but i would not recommend it for anybody who is a certified open water diver planning to dive below 25 feet."

I also own this waterproof case:&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Dicapac-WP-ONE-Point-Shoot-Digital-Camera-Waterproof-Case/dp/B005IAXVMG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Dicapac WP-ONE Point & Shoot Digital Camera Waterproof Case</a>&nbsp;It's almost half the price of the Polaroid model and has much better quality optical plastic mounted in front of the lens.  There's no excuse for the Polaroid model which costs almost twice as much (20 vs 12) not to have at least equal or better quality optical plastic in front of the lens.  Here is a link to the optical plastic in front of the lens on the Polaroid model:<br /><br /> http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1EE5Q07L80P5G/B0050051QI/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link<br /><br /> - 1 star for fit.  I know this is supposed to be a generic case for the most popular point and shoot cameras on the market.  However, I feel like Polaroid failed to do their market research because the Canon S95/100/110/120 is a very popular series of cameras which gets high reviews on many websites.  This camera is probably as popular as the ipad.  It would have been smart for them to at least make the case compatible with one of the highest rated and most popular series of cameras currently on the market.  Here are links to pictures showing fitment of a Canon S110:<br /><br /> http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1CYJ2ZZ7YEX5C/B0050051QI/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link<br /> http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/moSFLQ92IZL8PO/B0050051QI/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link<br /> http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/moRV9MNMWXLEKE/B0050051QI/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link<br /> http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/moNNN4BP06PPHM/B0050051QI/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link<br /><br />Other than that, this is a REALLY great waterproof camera case.  I would even pay $5 more if they made these improvements in a version 2.0 model.<br /><br />I am torn between keeping this one and just putting up with its flaws or returning it and waiting for a better redesign to come out.  I guess they won't be motivated to redesign if people keep their cases, so I think I'll send this back and hopefully, Polaroid will get the message."

I wanted to use it for snorkeling.  I used it for snorkeling and I used it for SO many other things that I would have missed out on photos for not wanting to risk my camera.  It worked like a charm.<br /><br />Before I even put my camera in this case, I put a couple paper towels in the case and submerged it in water in my sink at home.  The paper towels were 100% dry after about 5 minutes under water. You have to hold it there as it floats, but that is also a good thing.  Then I tested the case with my camera in the sink.  It too stayed dry.  After another review, I took the strap off my Canon Powershot ELPH 330 and attached it to the waterproof case.  This saved a lot of time trying to stuff the cord in there, plus it gave an extra handle on the camera case.<br /><br />Then we took it Hawaii.<br />We went to the waterpark at our resort - I used this on the slide, the lazy river, under the waterfalls and on the beach.<br />We brought it with us snorkeling in Kauai.  It took some nice shots, although it is tough to see what you are shooting underwater.<br />We went on a catamaran tour with the waves splashing on the boat, I didn't have to shield my camera like everyone else.<br />We took it on a muddy ATV tour - still nothing inside the case.<br />It was also great for making a drop/crash shield of sorts for my camera in places that I was less stable on my feet.<br /><br />All of those memories would just be in my head if not for this case.  It worked like a charm.<br />I only gave it 4 stars because it isn't perfect.  Here are some things to be mindful of with this case:<br />1. This is just a generic case and not built for your specific camera.  You have to use the shutter and power buttons through the soft plastic of the case.  It works, but it can be tricky.<br />2. With cameras that use a zoom dial as opposed to a button, you will have no way to zoom.  Some of the things I photographed are only so-so because a zoom would have helped a lot.  Still, without this case, there would be not photo at all.  So it's a compromise.<br />3. As I said, underwater, it can be hard to see the LCD screen because of a glare or your goggles might fog.  It's here that point and shoot really became literal for me.  Still, I got some great photos that I otherwise wouldn't have had at all.<br /><br />If you are going anywhere with water or that you might get a little dirty - hands down - get this case!  It was the BEST purchase I made for my trip to Hawaii and everyone we met in Hawaii wanted to know where to get one - including the locals!"

It works ok, but my older Cybershot fits a little too snug. It severely limits camera functionality, don't expect to use all of your settings while its encased in this thing. The clear laminate scratches and clouds easily. Overall not a great alternative to a more expensive waterproof camera or custom fit case."

I have a Sony Cybershot DSC-WX350 and was terrified about getting it wet. I went snorkeling on a tropical vacation and wanted to make sure that I had my camera during the entire trip. Before putting my camera in it, I tested it in the sink and it worked fine. After putting my camera in it, I only noticed one that that could be a minor problem. This will vary depending on the size of your camera and where the buttons are located on it. When the lens extends, my camera didn't have too much wiggle room so it would be easy to get it into a setting or a menu that you don't want it to be in. I went snorkeling in the ocean for about an hour with my camera on the entire time. I was able to take pictures easily and the only issue I had was that I somehow pushed a button that put the shooting on a two second delay. I was still able to take hundreds of pictures underwater. I even swam down about 15 feet toward the bottom of the ocean where the pressure was much higher and this still functioned perfectly. After an hour of swimming around, I was very excited to see the pictures that I had taken and was even more happy that not a drop of water nor a single bead of moisture made it in! My camera was completely protected. Anyway, after looking at the pictures, I was stunned. They came out crystal clear and looked amazing! I'm so glad I purchased this case. It's well worth the small price! One other side note, I don't know if it would make a difference but I left my flash off. I had assumed that if the flash were on, it may make a glare. Just thought I'd put that out there. Overall, I'd HIGHLY recommend this camera housing and in fact, I already did to many friends who were stunned when they saw how beautiful the pictures came out!"

I used it with a Nikon Coolpix. It was water-proof, did not get one bit wet, and it did take great pictures, but there were a couple drawbacks. First off, and this is minor, I did figure it out, but I almost broke it trying to get it open because I didn't understand how. Once open I found the instructions on the INSIDE. Once it's in the casing you really can't adjust any of the settings besides on/off and the shutter button - you need to either make sure they are set before you load it into the housing or be stuck taking it apart in possibly a wet sandy setting. That's not to say that that makes this a bad product, I'm sure many of the housings out there are the same, it's just something to keep in mind. No zoom will be available (at least with the Nikon Coolpix) because it is not flexible enough to move that button. Set it before loading it into the housing. You absolutely need to make sure the flash / auto-flash is turned off otherwise it reflects within the housing and makes the picture nothing but a glow of white. I experimented with it before the trip so all our water photos on the trip turned out great. Will I use it again? Absolutely, it took good photos and kept my camera dry for $20!!"

We bought it instead of going the old underwater camera route for our trip to the Caribbean.  For $20 I was skeptical, but it worked like a champ.  It is easy to use, our camera fit into it perfectly.  I was able to turn the camera on and off and take pictures underwater with no issue.  I couldn't operate the tiny zoom button through the housing but it wasn't a problem.  I only used it snokeling and down to about 8 feet so I am not sure how it would perform in deeper water.<br />We took the advice of a previous reviewer and took the wrist strap off of the camera before putting it in the housing and then put the strap on the housing itself.  It might be easier to just get another strap for the housing and just be careful to have the camera strap fully in the housing and out of the way of the lens instead of having to switch it on and off.<br />And it floats - which was handy when I needed to let go of it to adjust my equipment.<br />Overall, this is a fabulous product!  No more taking underwater pictures and then having them developed to find out they didn't turn out."

It helps position a smaller camera.<br /><br />I could navigate the touch screen on the camera while in the water.  It got a little 'wonky' when diving with it, because a lot of the case is soft to allow the buttons to work.<br /><br />The pictures came out really good.  There is a little bit of an issue on the periphery of some of the images due to glare of the plastic, but considering the price point it is a great trade-off.<br /><br />I have purchased other underwater cases in the past.

I did test it using the cloth included for that purpose ahead of time with no leaks or moisture getting inside the case.  I never kept the camera underwater for extended times, but when in the water, including underwater, it never had any issues with moisture.  While saying it is designed to use with flash, the design itself is flawed, causing a glare in the corner of the image from the flash reflecting on the case.  I simply turned off the flash, but there were times it would have been nice to use.  Additionally, I found I couldn't zoom all the way using the case, and if I zoomed too far out it would cause error readings on the camera itself, requiring it to be shut off and back on again.  For the price, though, these cons are minor for protecting a digital camera from the water."

Using the zoom on your camera isn't happening; it's too difficult to get to.

Also, the water droplets of course are all over the outside, and so any pictures look pretty bad.  Underwater is ok, I guess, but you can't really even see what you're taking a picture of and it comes out so dark (my camera's fault though, not the case). We've been using it for snorkeling, but it just hasn't really served its purpose.  Our pictures taken up above the water look like crap because of the water all over the front plastic piece.

I have a Sony Cybershot DSC-WX350 and was terrified about getting it wet. I went snorkeling on a tropical vacation and wanted to make sure that I had my camera during the entire trip. Before putting my camera in it, I tested it in the sink and it worked fine. After putting my camera in it, I only noticed one that that could be a minor problem. This will vary depending on the size of your camera and where the buttons are located on it. When the lens extends, my camera didn't have too much wiggle room so it would be easy to get it into a setting or a menu that you don't want it to be in. I went snorkeling in the ocean for about an hour with my camera on the entire time. I was able to take pictures easily and the only issue I had was that I somehow pushed a button that put the shooting on a two second delay. I was still able to take hundreds of pictures underwater. I even swam down about 15 feet toward the bottom of the ocean where the pressure was much higher and this still functioned perfectly. After an hour of swimming around, I was very excited to see the pictures that I had taken and was even more happy that not a drop of water nor a single bead of moisture made it in! My camera was completely protected. Anyway, after looking at the pictures, I was stunned. They came out crystal clear and looked amazing! I'm so glad I purchased this case. It's well worth the small price! One other side note, I don't know if it would make a difference but I left my flash off. I had assumed that if the flash were on, it may make a glare. Just thought I'd put that out there. Overall, I'd HIGHLY recommend this camera housing and in fact, I already did to many friends who were stunned when they saw how beautiful the pictures came out!"

I used it with a Nikon Coolpix. It was water-proof, did not get one bit wet, and it did take great pictures, but there were a couple drawbacks. First off, and this is minor, I did figure it out, but I almost broke it trying to get it open because I didn't understand how. Once open I found the instructions on the INSIDE. Once it's in the casing you really can't adjust any of the settings besides on/off and the shutter button - you need to either make sure they are set before you load it into the housing or be stuck taking it apart in possibly a wet sandy setting. That's not to say that that makes this a bad product, I'm sure many of the housings out there are the same, it's just something to keep in mind. No zoom will be available (at least with the Nikon Coolpix) because it is not flexible enough to move that button. Set it before loading it into the housing. You absolutely need to make sure the flash / auto-flash is turned off otherwise it reflects within the housing and makes the picture nothing but a glow of white. I experimented with it before the trip so all our water photos on the trip turned out great. Will I use it again? Absolutely, it took good photos and kept my camera dry for $20!!"
