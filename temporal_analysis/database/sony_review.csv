Sony,Sony A3000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 18-55mm Lens,20150918,B00EH5UGR6,4,0,0,"on September 18, 2015",ANONYMOUS,I love this camera,"I love this camera.  It is confusing in that it has the body of a full DSLR camera but is more compact in weight and slightly smaller Sony E mount lenses.  The video screen on the back panel is good for indoors but unfortunately gets washed out in bright sunlight.  This model, unlike most of the other cameras in the ILC family, has a viewfinder which works perfectly fine in bright sunlight so that is a big plus against other models in Sony Alpha cameras which most of the others have no viewfinder.  Unfortunately that viewfinder is not optical and is just another LCD screen at fairly low resolution so you cannot see the full quality of the photos you take until you move the photos off camera.  While the quality of the viewfinder is less than perfectly desirable, it serves its purpose and there is no compromise of quality in the final photos that can be taken with this camera which very often can run circles around other cameras out there 3 to 4 times the price of this camera!  The lighter weight and the high quality no compromise of the final photos that can be taken with this camera makes this the perfect choice when you want to have a good camera that is lighter weight such aa for carrying on hiking trips for example or, you are simply going to places where you don't want to risk losing or damaging your more expensive cameras.  Being over two years old, this is not exactly the newest camera in Sony's alpha lines but it still holds its own very well and is unmatched when it comes to the quality of photos this camera can produce.  Almost all cameras in this price range would be mostly simple snapshot fixed lense cameras with much smaller optics that take far inferior photos making this camera an incredible steal for the price"

She has a point and shoot, wants a digital SLR, but isn't the most careful when it comes to electronics.  Naturally, I am not willing to buy the DSLR until I see more maturity and care and I thought this camera would give her the chance to prove herself worthy of that kind of expense.  Unfortunately, my plan was a flop.<br /><br />I don't know if we got a bad one or there was a crummy bunch and that is why they were offered at such a discount what, but the resolution on the LCD screen was absolutely horrible.  The electronic viewfinder was only marginally better.  After spending 10-15 minutes making sure there were not some simple adjustments that needed to made, it was clear this was not a good choice so we immediately boxed it back up and returned it."

First let me say that the sensor and the 18 -55mm kit lens that comes with it is superb. It's photo performance is great for the price. The only drawback in my view is the LCD viewer. It is not all that good but, it is adequate, and what it lacks in clarity in view is made up when you process the image. It is intuitive in its programing which makes it easy to use manual and aperture priority. I am very pleased with its image quality all the way up to 3200 ISO. I would recommend this for anyone that is beginning photography or looking for an inexpensive camera that delivers the photo quality of cameras twice and three times the price."

I am amazed at the quality almost every time I use it. I really like the viewfinder because it works great on sunny days when seeing the LCD screen is nearly impossible. I still do not know how to completely use it but I have taken some beautiful shots with it so far. I have not really used the original lens that came with it. I did not care for it for the types of photos I am taking, so I cannot comment on the quality of it. The battery life is amazing, and I love that you can see a percentage of how much is left. My old point and shoot did not have that and it would die on me a lot without much warning. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I decided a mirrorless camera was the way to go for me because carrying a bulkier and much more expensive DSLR camera around did not appeal to me. The icing on the cake is when the price dropped to $249 before I was about to buy it. It was already on sale but then dropped again, so I had no reason not to get it.  Overall I am thrilled with my purchase and will plan on using this camera far into the future as I grow with photography."

Because the image on the camera's display or viewer is not quite representative of what the end result is, it's good if you have the patience to get to know the camera's true capability and memorizing what each setting will record like in the end.  I feel its a good skill to develop if you are serious about cinematography.

Sony,Sony A3000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 18-55mm Lens,20140415,B00EH5UGR6,4,8,10,"on April 15, 2014",ANONYMOUS,Say what? This is not a DSLR?,"This is a camera for the niche market. If you are a beginner and in the market for a DSLR, skip this and get one of the Canon Rebels or Nikon D3xxx for a bit more money. You would be more happy. The EVF and LCD on the A3000 are too low rez by today 's standard, however, they are sufficient for the job. I tried this camera before I bought it at Walmart which was selling it for $319. Underneath its skin, there is no mirror nor prism at all. In fact, it 's a NEX in disguise. Make no mistake about it. What you gain over the entry level NEX3 is the EVF which is nice for framing in broad daylight. With peaking assist, I could nail the focus with auto magnification. Sony has implemented this quite successfully by borrowing the same feature from the NEX product line. Now the best part of this camera is the 20.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor. This is arguably one of the best APS-C sensors I have seen. It surpasses Canon 's offering in terms of dynamic range and noise probably only topped by the 24 Megapixel sensor from Nikon/Sony/Pentax in which you have to pay a lot more money for their bodies. If you shoot RAW, you could squeeze a lot out of the A3000 CMOS sensor using Adobe Lightroom. I kid you not, If you don't get any good picture out of this camera, you do not know what you are doing. One thing that strikes me is that why Sony restricts to RAW+JPEG when I want to choose RAW. It wastes storage space in the SD card. Also there is no battery charger that comes with the camera. Yes, you have to plug the camera into a wall socket using a USB2 cord. Not a big deal, but it's a strange arrangement. Sony also has implemented HDR and panoramic function with the A3000 and I applaud these features. They come in handy when I don't want to use my smartphone for better image quality.<br /><br />What astounds me about this camera is the low price and the image quality. It even comes with a metal mount 18-55mm OSS kit lens and a hood (Hello Canikon !!). The kit lens itself could very well cost about $150 in retail. How Sony makes any profit out of this camera is beyond me. The build for the camera body is no slouch either. It has a grip that I could comfortably wrap my fingers around. Its user interface is the typical NEX style with deep menus. Don't let that scare you. The deep menu would slow you down but its graphical interface is quite intuitive.<br /><br />So why 4 stars? Simply because it 's not perfect and there is room for improvement most notably the EVF and LCD. For the price you are paying, you are getting a lot of camera with the A3000 when compared with other competition. However having said that, you really need to know what you are getting yourself into before you push the BUY button for this camera. It 's not for everyone unless you know what you need for your photography."

This A3000 camera has several in-camera HDR options....again all in-camera...that create dramatic effects you would work your rear end off doing on the computer sandwiching a series of bracketed photos.<br /><br />I have used it in Sedona ...just stunning, jaw dropping HDR effects and hand held and easily done.......it is like the Sony A37 and others in the Alpha series re the HDR capabilities and the A3000 has an APS-C sensor ...so it immediately separates itself from so called fixed lens bridge cameras since they all have tiny sensors.<br /><br />How Sony can price a version of an  SLR like this at this price (again Amazon is totally out of line in their price currently) is beyond me....even their small CYBER shots are more expensive and their NEX line doesn't offer built in view finders like this one which uses the same E mount lenses.  The A3000 is kind of odd in that it is more in the Alpha series but then again it has a big foot in the NEX series because of the lens mount..  It is sort of like an A37 that uses E mount lenses instead of Sony/Minolta auto focus mount lenses!!!<br /><br />The A3000 differs from the A37 in other ways as well since a lot more of its functions are in the menu..So you MUST know the menu to be able to really get the most out of the A3000. It is much lighter and smaller than the A37. But it is just as capable giving on pause why they would pay almost double for the A58 which is commonly known as the A37's evolutionary offspring...This A3000 came to earth out of nowhere since it is an E mount camera but looks nothing like an NEX line of camera...<br /><br /> It has been mentioned here that you can use old glass by using very cheap and easily found lens adapters like Canon EOS or Nikon to E mount...These sell from 12 dollars to 25 dollars on Amazon and EBAY.....Yes you lose the auto focus ability...but the vibration technology is in the body not the lens on Sony cameras.  The meter system of course will still work by you setting the aperture on the lens and then the camera will automatically set the shutter speed.  You have to tell the camera when you do this manual operation telling it that there is no lens on the camera which is an odd way of telling it to recognize the manual adapter...or a T mount adapter....You have to find that entry in the menu or else the camera will not work under these conditions unlike most other DSLR's in which you just mount these adapters and that's it... Not so with Sony.<br /><br />I have used this camera extensively at Joshua Tree and Sedona...re the HDR effects...<br /><br /> I have used it with people in a patio setting with high contrast problems abounding and it does a spectacular job. The slats in the patio cover with the sun  (yes we have had lots of sun in SOCAL this winter) created lines of high contrast areas but with the HDR working, it automatically resolved/mitigated that issue without the use of fill flash.....though of course that too is available with the A3000.<br /><br />I own a lot of Nikon pro models but carry these Sony cameras with me as well due to the sensor size and the HDR capabilities..<br /><br />Again this is the best SLR-like value in the history of digital cameras bar none since you can pick this up between 248-279 dollars pretty commonly right now.. This is stupidly under priced ...<br /><br />The 18-55mmm kit lens is perfect for most shooting situations....The only drawback is the LCD and EVF are not eye controlled like on the A37.....you have to push a button to switch between the two....<br /><br />the same FW50 battery is also used on the A37/A33 and others in the Alpha line.... (the A58 does NOT use the FW50 battery).  You can pick up external 3rd party dual battery chargers as well for around 20 dollars on EBAY and possibly AMAZON since AMAZON has now caught on big time to making lots of camera accessories that you used to find only on EBAY...Amazon rocks in this regard from lens mount adapters to 3rd party batteries and battery chargers...<br /><br />One of the nicest features on this A3000 camera is that in manual mode, the EVF or LCD will show you EXACTLY what the the image will look like!  You can  let in more or less light  by adjusting the shutter and/or aperture  depending on the situation and you can see exactly what the final image will look like if not using HDR.....  So you don't have to take a photo and then review it and then make adjustments....<br /><br />This Sony A3000 is kind of what you see is what you get...the A37 operates the same way.. Being able to see real time your adjustments taking place is just great......for example if you have the lens wide open and you reach too slow of a shutter speed, you can just change the ISO and it will then give you some more parameters to play with .......and the raising of the ISO number will brighten the image instantly on the EVF/LCD so you can start looking at grain issues though this camera is capable of mitigating that as well..automatically!<br /><br />Again...the in-camera HDR  abilities of this camera scream out 'BUY ME' ..and at this price who can resist?...The HDR can show up in automatic ways on some of the auto settings and low light settings...but you have control of it in the DRIVE mode .and Sony has an HDR painterly effect in another menu that that gives you a choice of low, medium, and high painterly effect.which can give a rich almost Van Gogh effect.<br /><br /> I was able to use this HDR painterly effect in near darkness in Sedona of Cathedral Rock while at Crescent Moon Ranch Park with just a faint afterglow illuminating this striking  feature while the sun had gone down behind the mountain in the distance on which Jerome is located .  The reflective ambient light of the western horizon afterglow was picked up reflected on Cathedral Rock using the high painterly HDR effect and it looked like 4 in the afternoon!  Utterly amazing....and by using manual exposure, I could see right there exactly the middle exposure for the HDR....so you don't get predictive HDR like I think the new Samsung Galaxy 5 will have....<br /><br />So the technique with the Sony in-camera HDR is to play with that the center photo exposure of the three that will be taken...since this is what in real time the LCD/EVF is revealing ..if you make that  middle exposure too underexposed then everything will shift in the 3 exposures to greatly underexpose what you are shooting...  So for example when it got very dark at Cathedral Rock, I let in as much light as I could so that the underexposure exposure of the three shots  was able to bring up enough shadow areas ..At some point you may need to then use a tripod but you will be shocked what you can get away with using the A3000 handheld...<br /><br />It is hard to explain but there is no rocket science to it....you just have to play with it to get the best HDR effect in very low light situations.  But the beauty of it is you see the results instantly and can make adjustments rather than waiting to get to a computer to process a series of bracketed photos....and of course this camera lets you bracket exposures in a traditional sense as well.  Also,  you can use other PSAM settings if you think the camera will do better than your own eyes using the manual control setting.<br /><br />If you get this camera...you MUST make a point of understanding where these HDR options are in the menu.  It is kind of lame of Sony to not explain how to use these incredible features BETTER in their promo literature or in the expanded camera manual ...you sort of have to figure this out on your own when (for my purposes) this is the very most important feature of the camera...the ONLY reason why I bought it (them).<br /><br />Why Sony doesn't elaborate on their astounding in-camera totally automatic HDR  processing is beyond me...I have taken thousands of images with the A3000 and A37 which both have exactly the same HDR functions.  I can attest to the fact that this is a revolutionary tool to have at your disposal while doing photography of all sorts.<br /><br />HDR is not meant to do a good job of subject matter in motion since there is a time span required to take three images of varying EV values.  In low light situations, you might want to use a tripod if you wish to avoid noise at high ISOs since the over exposure shot in the sequence could be considerably slower than the under exposure at the other end of the EV spectrum...<br /><br />When you take an HDR photo in low light it has been my experience that it takes longer ..much longer...for the camera to process the final image...The camera seems to be really thinking things out under those low light conditions....it is not instantaneous....<br /><br />This is the  best value EVER in a digital SLR-like removable lens camera.....EVER!!  Selling for well under 300 dollars elsewhere,<br /><br />I don't care if you have a 2,000 to 7,000 dollar camera, you should have one of these feather weight gems in your bag as well....<br /><br />You cannot buy a new camera this cheaply with all of Sony's latest technologies inside AND an APS-C sensor to boot....heck even SONY doesn't sell such full featured cameras like this themselves but this one huge exception..  I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when they had the meeting to create this model A3000 cuz it ain't an NEX and it really ain't a full on Alpha series camera either..<br /><br />Dang..I think I might buy another one of these before somebody at Sony wakes up and figures out they made some kind of corporate mistake!!!!  The consumer wins big time on the A3000.  What a deal!!!  SORRY FOR ANY TYPOS..I AM WORN OUT..<br /><br />EVERYBODY SHOULD OWN ONE OF THESE A3000'S ....A CLASSIC UNDER-THE-RADAR CAMERA!!!!!!  A TRUE SONY MIRACLE BOTH IN FEATURES AND PRICING...."

You are not going to find better picture quality for this price, period.<br /><br />If you think that you're going to stick to the kit lens (and believe me it's very good), you are getting a bargain. But if in doubt, be prepared to lay out the same amount for a decent telephoto lens.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- decent sensor<br />- amazing photo and video quality<br />- kit lens is very good<br /><br />Con:<br />- well, the viewfinder could have been better<br />- getting a new lens might cost as much as the camera itself<br /><br />I've wanted to move up to a DSLR for quite a while now, but I just couldn't accept the fact that I am going to pay $700+ just to get decent photo quality. And let's face it, entry-level DSLR's from Nikon and Canon are not that great, so I was really in despair. Not that I can't afford it, I just couldn't justify such a toy.<br /><br />This camera is an answer to that. Picture quality is amazing! It is not a real DSLR, I know, there is no mirror in its design, it's a NEX camera shaped as DSLR, but hey, less moving parts, and the result is the same, so why not.<br /><br />The camera is very comfortable to hold, beats any other NEX camera I've played with. Viewfinder is mediocre, but I used it only once or twice.<br /><br />I don't know why do people complain about the screen? It is a very decent and precise screen. I need to wear glasses to notice it's 'grainy'.<br /><br />Sounds like Sony is getting rid of A mount altogether. Maybe cheaper E mount lenses are just around the corner.. Anyway, if you are still in doubt, it's a great buy.<br /><br />UPD Sep 15 2014:<br />I ended up getting the Sony 55-210 E mount lens, and the results are mind-blowing. Everyone keeps saying how good the photos are, and asks me what camera I have. Also if you go to the camera support page, there's a link to a free training course from Sony on basics of digital photography, composition etc. for this particular camera! I seriously recommend you watch this, and do the exercises attached. This will get you out of the Auto mode slowly, on the way to great landscapes, portraits and more!<br /><br />Last but not least, if you are worried there are not enough physical controls on the camera body, worry no more! You can assign a quick menu to the ISO button, that will present you with 6 settings you would control most often, instead of just the ISO selection. I keep ISO, focus mode, focus area, metering mode, white balance and quick picture style selection (B/W for example) there, it is very handy and you can change the setting in no time!<br /><br />Even more highly recommended after 2 months of use!"

This is really apart of the Sony NEX line as it takes e-mount lenses.  My only really big disappointment is the screen resolution in the viewfinder and screen are horrid and the colors in the viewfinder tend to be distorted.

I am not an experienced photographer. I do not know what FSTOP is or anything even remotely close. I bought this due to the 20 mpixels and the other good reviews and if it hadn't done what I needed I would have returned it. So far been very happy with it. I shoot everything on auto or enhanced auto and take A LOT of photos of my young children. I particularly love the multishot feature; I can just hold down the button and take 20-30 shots one after another. Great for getting shots of the kids running, playing, jumping, whatever. Shots outside are magnificent. Indoor shots look much better than what my iphone has been giving me. Bottom line: if you don't know much of anything about cameras and shoot on auto, you will have no trouble with this camera whatsoever and the pictures will look great. ONE downside that I knew about before ordering: no real zoom. You can change lenses and get the real zoom for about $300, the same price as the camera. Is it worth it then once you add in the zoom? Maybe not. But the pictures look awesome, camera very easy to use, and I'll probably just stick with it. If you really want the zoom and a cheaper camera and pics that don't look quite this good check out the Nikon L820. $200 or less and has an awesome zoom. Pics don't look quite this good and it isn't the same kind of DSLR type camera as this Sony but still good."

Yes, it is a fake DSLR. It looks like one, but has no mirror. It is like a car with automatic tranny that has a handle looking like standard shifter. In fact, this camera is like car with automatic transmission, all attempts to compare it with DSLR are  like comparing to a car with standard shift, it is just not. Following that analogy this camera does a very good job, while making it easy for the driver/photographer. You have all the semi-auto modes of DSLR Plus full manual and full auto. The only true fake thing here is the view finder: you do not see through the lens, cause it is not an optical feature, but will be looking at tiny LED repeater of larger screen. It is, however,  adequate to the task of framing the shot and peaking the AF on a sunny day when screen is not useful. The lens is very impressive, very little distortion for the money, it alone should cost as much as $300 I paid for entire set at Amazon Prime. If you are an amateur tired of point-and-shoot and want to start playing with interchangeable lens, shatter speed, aperture, field depth or at least heard about those terms, go for it. Just keep in mind that next lens you may want may cost more than this entire camera. You may not need a tele- lens though, since the digital zoom is exceptional and sensor is huge."

Unless you are looking at a review from a professional site that does nothing but camera reviews, most consumer reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt! You have to keep in mind that for a review to have meaning, you must know what camera(s) the consumer is comparing the A3000 to and if the photos are being taken under similar conditions. Comparing the A3000 to a 6MP Canon is useless and so is comparing photos that are shot under different lighting conditions or using different ISO settings or different lenses (zoom versus wide angle).<br /><br />I am not going to go into all of the details as to which camera has what features since my primary concern is picture quality followed by video quality. Features are great but would rather have fewer features but better photos and videos!<br /><br />I took all four cameras, put them on a tripod and shot photos using the standard 18-55mm kit lens that came bundled with the camera. I took photos of a house on the side of a hill that is located about 500 yards away and then enlarged the resulting JPEG files on my computer using a 23&#34; HP LCD screen. I did not print them out but viewed them at 200-300% to check out every bit of detail. I used ISO speed from 100 to 3200 to get an idea of how well the noise reduction worked on each camera without sacrificing image quality,<br /><br />RESULTS: The best camera from ISO 100 to 1600 - Sony A3000. The second best - Canon T3i ( not as good as the Sony from ISO 100-1600, but just a little better than the Sony at 3200), third place goes to to the Olympus E-PL1 which did very well when you consider that it has a 12mp sensor versus the others that range from 14.2MP to 20.1MP. In LAST place is the Nikon D3100.<br /><br />The D3100 is better than my old Nikon D40x for sure but not as good as any of the other cameras I used in this comparison. You could say that it is not fair since the Nikon has 14.2MP and the others that rated better have 18-20MP. But then, the Olympus with 12.3MP also did better than the D3100!<br /><br />In terms of Video quality, the Canon T3i and Sony A3000 are pretty close with the T3i being slightly better. The Olympus PL1 fell to last place because the output is in 720p when all the others are 1080p. Nikon D3100 took third place in video quality.<br /><br />Hope that helps a little in clearing up some of the picture quality issues between at least this batch of cameras."
Sony,Sony A3000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 18-55mm Lens,20140223,B00EH5UGR6,5,4,4,"on February 23, 2014",ANONYMOUS,The Price is Right!,"I own an Olympus E-510 DSLR, and a Canon Powershot G1 X (among a couple other pocket cameras).  This has replaced both, and at substantially less than I paid for my other gear.  If you can pick up this kit from Amazon for under $300, and your priority is image quality, then don't hesitate.  I was able to pick this camera up with the extra Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 OSS Lens for $427.00 total.  At the time of this writing, Amazon is still offering the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 OSS Lens for $200.00 off, if purchased with this camera.  You won't see a better deal for a mirrorless system with stellar image quality.  The resolution of both the EVF viewfinder and the rear LCD is lower than that of a lot of competitors' cameras, but you have to expect some corner cutting for this price.  The image quality is superb.  There is a lot of value in the features.  And at this low price your getting into the Sony E-mount lens system, and can always upgrade the body later.  Currently, it can't be beat."

However, the adapter makes them stick out from the front of the camera far enough that they unbalance it.  The a3000 with it's SLR styling solves that.  The grip is deep and comfortable and makes larger, heavier lens a joy to use.  In fact, I don't use this camera with auto focus lenses ever.  I have a decent collection of M42 (Screwmount) lenses that I use with it.  The adapter for these is always on the camera.  The focus peaking and zoom in assist make it a breeze to focus.  This is also the only camera I've used with manual lenses that works in the &#34;intelligent&#34; modes with any lens.  It even exposes the flash correctly.<br /><br />In short, if your looking to get into the world of manual focus lenses cheaply, this is the camera for you."
Sony,Sony A3000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 18-55mm Lens,20140206,B00EH5UGR6,5,11,12,"on February 6, 2014",ANONYMOUS,Great camera.,"My first impression is that the A3000 is a 5-star camera. My last camera (PowerShot G15) was unceremoniously retired when I had to jump into a lake. Before that, I owned a Nikon D90 with a Nikkor 50mm 1.4 and 24mm 2.8D.<br /><br />The Canon was a great camera with a great lens, but my wife and I were always disappointed with its image quality vs. what we'd had with the D90. It (the G15) had all of the manual control I could ask for but lacked punch in low light situations. Also, its sensor size vs. that of the D90 was quite underwhelming. Abysmal, really.<br /><br />So, the Canon was drowned but, due to my having purchased a warranty, I was reimbursed for the current value of the camera. I went to the store expecting to get the Sony Nex-3N, but saw this camera. I will take a low-res EVF over no finder any day of the week.<br /><br />Regarding that: I have seen detractors of this camera for its low-res EVF and display. Those things don't bother me, as I don't spend very much time on composition and just like to ensure that everything that I want to capture in the frame is there. Don't expect to be impressed by the LCD on the back, either.<br /><br />Besides, the thing that matters is the output. Looking at the photos on the computer, quality is great. Even ISO 3200 images look good enough for snapshots or other casual shooting.<br /><br />The camera is not fast compared to DSLRs, but it's fast enough. Because there are not many external controls, you have to go through menus to access settings. It takes a little more time but that's fine with me. If i want manual control, it's there... but as time goes on, I want to spend less time on all of that and more time on composition. Sony's iAuto setting seems capable enough.  However, everything about it (except maybe the AF) seems sluggish in comparison to the Nikon, though that may not be an entirely accurate nor objective statement.<br /><br />As far as build quality goes, this camera is very light and doesn't feel like there's much to it. I suspect that is because there *isn't* very much to it. At this price point, I feel as though I've paid for an excellent image sensor and the basic means by which to get light there. I think the minimalist nature (and not minimalist in the same way as a Leica, obviously) is very nice.<br /><br />It doesn't necessarily feel cheap, either. I worked in a camera shop for 5 years and handled plenty of entry-level DSLR's (including the original A33 and A55 SLTs), and this feels no less capable durable than any of those. Having said that, it by no means feels rugged. I wouldn't drop it, and would invest in any drop and spill protection. It might survive a knock or two, though.<br /><br />The playback mode doesn't auto-rotate the image (or if it does, I haven't found that setting). In playback, you can choose to rotate the photos manually. Also, the inability of the camera to switch back and forth to the finder automatically can be a little aggravating when you have to press the Finder/LCD button up top. Oh well. Again, this is just the sensor and the basics to get your image there. Lens is capable enough too. It was able to satisfactorily resolve some geese about 50 yards away when zoomed all the way (both with the lens and with the zoom function in playback).<br /><br />Memory Card: Sandisk Ultra 8 gig. Great cards.<br />Bag: Lowepro Hatch Back 16L. Great bag with the all-important AW cover."

What I like about A3000 is the hefty grip to hold it. I wish all mirrorless cameras had such grip. I don't know why NEX/Olympus/FUJI make their bodies compact with larger SLR-like grips. Because after attaching most lenses, all cameras get bulky. Yes, some NEX cameras like 5T/6/7 do have good grips but nothing like A3000. I'm not going to bash A3000 for its EVF. It's an entry level camera and I don't even expect it to be there. Sony could have just made this camera w/o the EVF, so that the body could have been a bit more compact. But oh well, at least the EVF has one redeeming feature. It is useful enough just to frame shots in bright sunlight, but that's about it.<br /><br />If you are planning to use manual focus lenses with adapters, it can be hard to focus for some shots, even with focus peaking activated. The LCD has painfully low resolution. I wish Sony had just skipped the EVF and made the camera with slightly higher resolution screen, at least 460K.<br /><br />Image quality is very good. NOTE: I'm going to talk about X A1, which has bayer sensor just like A3000, I'm NOT talking abour X-trans sensors. I have used Fuji X A1 and I have to say the RAW images from A3000 are just as good up to ISO 400, and almost as good up to ISO 1600. After that the images are good enough, but has higher noise than the Fuji. Jpeg images from A3000, however have not as much noise(but loss of fine detail) due to aggressive noise reduction by BIONZ processor. I don't know why this sensor has so much noise compared to the Fuji. Perhaps because of higher pixel density? From ISO 800-12000 the darker areas in images have way too much noise and you will see a lot of hot pixels, even at faster shutter speeds. I have seen numerous samples from other 16MP Sony sensors, but this 20MP sensor has much higher grain/noise and tendency to show lot more hot pixels. But again, this is only relevant if you go above ISO 800.<br /><br />I have read reports of pattern noise from sensor in videos from A3000 by other reviewers. But really, this is a still image camera and it takes very good images for not a lot of money. If you are a serious video shooter then I suppose you should look for cameras like Canon or even other Sony cameras.<br /><br />It has plenty of manual modes to boot and good auto modes. It only shoots at 3.5 fps but I don't think this should be an issue, unless you make a living as a hardcore sports photographer or something similar. A3000 does have plenty of manual modes like most entry level DSLRs and mirrorless cameras.<br /><br />Overall for the price I paid($279), this is unbeatable camera and easily matches the image quality of X A1 and it has comparable image quality to any camera under $1000.<br /><br />Only these are the real cons according to me for A3000.<br />- I wish there was no EVF, so that the camera could have been just a bit more compact. EVF used here is useless 99% times anyway.<br />- I wish Sony had just omitted the EVF and went with at least 460k LCD, for an easier manual focusing. But really no complaints for the price I paid($279).<br />- The 20MP sensor from A58 demonstrates higher noise than comparable sensors(perhaps because of higher pixel density on APS C size).<br />- When using ISO 3200(and onwards), way too many hot pixels. More than any other camera I have used at same ISO and shutter speeds. Perhaps I have a defective sensor on my A3000."

Sony,Sony A3000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 18-55mm Lens,20140925,B00EH5UGR6,5,0,0,"on September 25, 2014",ANONYMOUS,An excellent camera for the price.,"I was on the hunt for my first serious digital camera, having shot point-and-shoots previously but also having experience with film SLRs.  The film market gets a little sadder each day, so I finally decided the time was right and I was ready to go digital.  The price was right on this Sony interchangeable-lens camera, and because it's mirrorless and has a very short distance from the flange to the sensor, it happily accepts an adapter to use my old film lenses.  (I use the&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Fotasy-NAFDT-Pro-Canon-FD-and-FL-Mount-Lens-to-Sony-NEX-E-Mount-Camera-Mount-Adapter-with-Tripod-Mount/dp/B003XY6HYS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Fotasy NAFDT Pro Canon FD and FL Mount Lens to Sony NEX E-Mount Camera Mount Adapter with Tripod Mount</a>, and it works brilliantly.)  It handles like a little digital SLR, but it's a mirrorless at heart, and I love that.<br /><br />Image quality on the 20 MP Exmor sensor (APS-C size, 1.5 crop factor) is nothing short of amazing, and for modestly sized enlargements it unequivocally beats 35mm film at speeds higher than ASA 200.  Low-light performance is pretty good as well, and I find images useful up to ASA 6400 for 5x7 prints and online use.  Images at ASA 100 are tack-sharp from corner to corner with the admittedly decent kit lens.  The raw files (Sony/Minolta ARW) import very well with Adobe Camera Raw, and I can get results that are on par with the colours of any of the films I shoot.<br /><br />The battery life is great; I got more than 300 shots on a trip to a small town and still had 45% battery left at the end of the day's events.  With a nice fast memory card, performance is pretty decent as well; I was able to keep shooting (fairly slowly, mind you -- it was a car show) throughout the entire event.  Autofocus is relatively quick, although you should bear in mind that my standards for this are pretty low since I'm accustomed to manual-focus film cameras, and because a lot of people expect faster autofocus performance from today's gear.<br /><br />I love the clickwheel-style control on the back of the camera, which lets you control all aspects of operation including the manual exposure settings.  I find the 'numerical match-needle metering' quite helpful in manual mode, since it tells you by how much your shot will be under/overexposed, rather than doing as my favourite Canon does and suggesting an aperture to match the selected shutter speed and ISO.<br /><br />The viewfinder isn't the greatest, but it does deliver the SLR feel and if you can overlook the grainy display quality (difficult, I realise, but bear with me), you'll find the general feel to be remarkably acceptable.  My biggest objection to going mirrorless versus digital SLR was the fact that I'd be losing a viewfinder, and I remain sceptical of electronic viewfinders -- but having an electronic one is better than not having one at all.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great still camera (I have no idea how the movie mode works and no reason to find out) and if I had to start over again, I'd still pick it since it delivers great performance for not a lot of money.<br /><br />One more thing: I recommend the&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Sony-E-55-210mm-F4-5-6-3-OSS-Lens-for-Sony-E-Mount-Cameras-Silver/dp/B005IHAIKM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 OSS Lens for Sony E-Mount Cameras (Silver)</a>&nbsp;telephoto zoom lens as one of the first couple you get for this camera.

I actually do not like many Sony products (too many bad experiences with them doing proprietary things on former products i owned). Besides, I already have a Nikon DSLR and Fuji HS-50 bridge camera...but one day while walking through a big box store i stumbled upon this camera at a wicked clearance price. I had read some hype on mirrorless cameras and the sony in specific and decided to get it, since i was never going to see that price again, and it would be nice to have an inexpensive camera in the car or to take on hikes.<br /><br />After taking a few pics with it, i was blown away as I was looking at images that rivaled my Nikon. The more I got into it, the more I began to like it and now I use it mostly because It is &#34;fun&#34;. I can purchase inexpensive adapters and use all my old classic lenses from old 35mm film cameras of the 70s/80s...like the vivitar 200mm, and I can also use my nikon lenses. Its just Fun to play around with all the combinations and get unique pics<br /><br />I am attaching images taken with the Sony...However, take note that only the DVD cover was taken with the kit lense (I shot that pic when I first got the camera and it was taken at night with room lights on). I believe the dog pics were taken with a Nikon lense (using an adapter).<br /><br />So is this a camera for the serious photographer? Maybe as a backup...<br />Is this a camera for the photo hobbyist who wants a lot of control? Sure.<br />Is this a camera for the photo buff who wants to get into the world of mirror less? Definitely<br />Is this a camera for someone with outdated equipment and would like to get more value from your lenses? Definately<br /><br />I believe Sony has really upset the balance of the camera manufacturer landscape with these cameras and would be shocked if Canon and Nikon did not respond with lower pricing and more features. If, at the time, Sony had any more traction in the market I would have purchased this to start with instead of my Nikon."

I got it on January 09, 2015. I immediately noticed how fast it drained the battery. It was even draining the battery overnight with the camera turned off, so I ordered 2 additional batteries and a charger. And I got in the habit of taking out the battery when I wasn't using the camera. I'm an engineer so I immediately started looking online for a remedy in various forums and conducting experiments to find out what was draining the battery so fast. After a lot of digging with no solution, I was going through all the menus one day and stumbled across Airplane Mode???<br /><br />Sony a6000 battery drain mystery solved!!! Turn Airplane Mode On! The a6000 supports Wi-Fi transfer of photos and videos to SmartPhones, Computers and other Wi-Fi devices. The default setting is Airplane Mode Off which drains the battery even with the camera off because it is always looking for nearby Wi-Fi devices. The solution is to turn Wi-Fi Off by turning Airplane Mode On. Only turn Airplane Mode Off when you want to send photos/videos to another Wi-Fi device. Then turn Airplane Mode On again as soon as you have finished sending. Problem solved."

I am one those amateurs who still own Canon camera and lenses and who have shifted to Sony mirrorless standard. My canon Eos 5D MkII still is my main camera, but I am using it less and less since I purchased the a6000. The main reason for the shift  is the quality of pictures I take with the Sony and the fact that I  can still use  my arsenal of Canon and Sigma lenses with the Sony. I own only L lenses as well as the well renowned Sigma 35 f1.4. In order to use them with the a6000 I bought the Viltrox adapter for $100  which allow me to stabilize the Sony camera (however it does not to allow to autofocus easily). The manual focus works very well but not all features of the a6000 are exploited.<br />Therefore  I decided to buy the magnificent Sony 50 f1.8 to match the a6000 with magnificent results. This fantastic lens is a beauty and I recommend it heartily to those owners of the  a6000. The photos captured with this lens are the most detailed I have ever taken in my life, even surpassing those taken with the Sigma 35 1.4. I think the main reason is that the Sony 50 1.6 has image stabilization which the Sigma does not have. The price is 4 times lower.<br />In short buy this camera and a 50mm which surpasses in quality both the 16-50 kit lens (which is very good) as well as the 55-210 which is also very good.<br />My advice for a future a6000 buyer is to get the 50 instead of the small 16-50."

I had thousands of dollars invested in lenses. The first two rebels were great cameras. Then I started to grow disappointed with each next Canon camera. 40D was awful. The 7D was better but still I was not happy and I could not afford a better body such as 5D. Also, I mainly shoot while hiking and I grew tired of hauling the mass of gear. After not shooting for over a year I figured it's time to change something.<br /><br />I also used Canon point and shoot cameras and, again, I was terribly disappointed with the quality and reliability. S95 died with the dreaded &#34;lens error&#34;. S100, also died in less than two years. So I started reading and discovered the SONY RX100II. It blew me away! In decent light I could not tell the difference between the RX100II and Canon 7D shots! So I started digging deeper since I never considered SONY cameras before and it came to a very hard choice between the a6000 and the A7.<br /><br />After studying very RAW file I could find on the internet for weeks I decided the slight difference in image quality was not worth 3x the price of the A7 for me.<br /><br />I bough the a6000 with the E PZ 18-105mm F4 G OSS. After the first shoot my jaw dropped. I could not believe it! This tiny $550 body and an $800 lens totally blew away the Canon 7D that costs three times as much. Anything from sharpness and color to speed of focus just wipes the floor with the 7D!<br /><br />So I sold all my Canon gear and bough another a6000 body and the FE 70-200mm F4 G OSS lens. I also bought the Rokinon 12mm F2.0 NCS CS lens and two sets of Vivitar chargers and batteries and AGFA filters. Both bodies, three lenses, 6 batteries, filters, etc fit in a small personal carry-on bag along with Macbook Air, iPad and lots of smaller items! I can carry both bodies on my shoulder and they're lighter and less bulky than one 7D with a tele lens! Sure these are some compromises as I don't have 400mm zoom or 2.8 speed but the kit produces stunning images that I am totally happy with at a fraction of the bulk. My entire photo gear in a small handbag!!!<br /><br />Just like the RX100II, the a6000 is an amazing marvel of modern technology that puts Nikon and Canon to shame. My hat's off to SONY for this achievement. I won't dive into specs. But yes, what people say about the quality, speed and features of this camera is all true. This is not hype. I didn't believe at first. This thing reinvigorated my interest in photography to the point that I took short vacation to go shooting in Death Valley.<br /><br />I can't find really anything wrong with this thing. Sure, it's not perfect, there are little annoyances such as the infamous video button but this is all overshadowed by the technological brilliance and stunning image quality that rivals midrange DSLRs.<br /><br />Speaking of video: with the G lenses this camera is a blast to use for video and produces gorgeous full HD at 60fps. I'm just not much into video.<br /><br />One significant drawback of the incredible set of features is high power draw. This thing goes through batteries quickly. Get the Vivitar or Wasabi kit with external charger and two extra batteries. I figure around 250 shots per battery and I'm not even using power zoom.<br /><br />And yeah, the unfortunate decision not to include a dedicated charger is just stupid. Come on SONY. In camera charging is not acceptable.<br /><br />In case you haven't figured this out yet: I really like this camera and the two SONY lenses!"

My previous camera was Sony RX1. Some may say I downgraded it, but honestly, I believe I made the right choice.<br />Sony A6000 meets and exceeds the expectation I had in digital camera. It is especially useful when you take outdoor activities where there are a lot of movements. I would have missed quite a lot of good moments if I kept/used my RX1, which is more of a street photography or a still portrait.<br />I used SONY 18-105 G lens. It’s not a superb lens, but I have no complaints about it.<br />Coming from SONY RX1 and Fuji cameras with silent shutters, a6000’s shutter sound is loud. I kind a like it. When I couple my a6000 with a zoom lens, it’s obvious to the people that I am taking photos. I don’t have to be discreet to them, so I might as well sound professional to the people by making loud continuous shutter sounds. However, I will not purchase those premium-brand prime lenses and couple them with A6000. I will be waiting patiently for RX1S or RX2 for that purpose."

Image quality is greater than expected thanks to the 24 million pixels Sony puts on the APS-C size sensor, so that you can get great image quality even at high ISO (&#62;3200).<br />As for the fast auto focusing I haven't experienced it yet because I only used my two manual focus lenses on it. Up to now I am not bothered by any red shift problem for the A6000 using the two rangefinder lenses (Voigtlander Nokton 35/1.4 and Zeiss ZM 25/2.8).<br />On the whole, I am pretty happy with this little guy on some street photography and casual occasions.

This offers manual and semi-manual shooting modes, RAW capture, built-in WiFi, apps, flip-out screen, compact size, array of lenses, 24p video and everything else you expect from a prosumer DSLR. In addition to these, there are custom Sony goodies like eye-focus, face-recognition and smile-shutter.

Other than telling the buyer rudimentary things such as how to insert the battery, put in a memory card, and set date and time (which are the same for all digital cameras), the A6000 Instruction Manual is 100 PERCENT USELESS.  The 44-page Instruction Manual merely lists the numerous features of the camera, but GIVES NO INFORMATION ON HOW TO ACCESS THOSE FEATURES, and gives zero information on  how to use them.<br /><br />I wasted 30 infuriating minutes trying to find 'Focus Peaking' and 'Focus Magnification' in the Menus of the A6000 - but they are nowhere in the Menus (where they can be found on my Sony A65), and ZERO INFORMATION on how to find, or use, these features is given in the Instruction Manual.<br /><br />When I got the ultra-complex Sony A6000 with its useless 'Instruction Manual' which provides no information, I was ready to return it after 2 days.<br /><br />Without far better information than is given in Sony's cheap, shoddy, inadequate 44-page Instruction Manual, the features of the Sony A6000 are unusable.<br /><br />(2) SLOW AUTOFOCUS. Using the Factory Settings (Default Settings), the Autofocus on my A6000 is ultra-slow, the camera 'hunts' back and forth for a full second - and often ends up completely out of focus!

With the Sony 55 - 210 mm telephoto zoom lens, Sony's autofocus system in the A6000 will often take a nearly-correct focus setting and change it to totally-out-of-focus, and then 'hunt' for focus. Sony's autofocus firmware for the A6000 desperately needs replacement. The Sony A6000 autofocus is slower than the earliest Autofocus cameras of the 1980s and 1990s.<br /><br />(3)  NO BATTERY CHARGER. The A6000 comes with no battery charger, but instead with a cable to allow the battery to be charged (slowly) from a computer's USB port. The battery must be in the camera, the recharge time is 310 minutes. This is Sony being cheap, and it's ridiculous.

Presently the latest is version 2.0.  Mine came with version 1.2 or 1.25.  I did mess around with it with the old firmware.  The shutter speed and auto focusing weren't as good as with the newer firmware.  I'm using this with a Tamron 18-200mm (B011).<br /><br />Versatile camera with plenty of features and options, just be prepared to learn what it can do.  The interface is fairly intuitive but it takes a little time to get acquainted with it.<br /><br />There is plenty of information out there on this camera. and what it can do.  Yes, it focuses very fast and it can fire away like crazy.  It's a little touchy when put in continuous mode, tapping the shoot button can mean accidently taking more than one shot.<br /><br />With the Tamron, autofocusing is fast and accurate with both photos and videos.  In my brief experience with the camera, I would recommend using the 2x clear zoom and cropping in post to get closer.  However, you can get some good shots using the 4x digital zoom but it's essentially the same as cropping in post.  Also, when you switch to the 4x digital zoom, you lose the ability to change some focus settings.<br /><br />To enable and use the eye autofocus you have to program it.  Not a big deal but kind of silly that you can't access it directly without &#34;programming&#34; it.<br /><br />Overall, it is a quality camera with tons of features and flexibility.  It can be a little tricky to handle with a larger lens on it like the Tamron 18-200mm.  It's just an adjustment and barely noteworthy.  The only downside that I found with the A6000 is the lack of lens selection.  There are a lot of adapters for using other lens.  However, they all seem to suffer from autofocus inefficiency.  On average....Four seconds to lock focus.  After doing a lot of research...The only viable option I found was Sony's LA-E2 adapter and a prime lens.<br /><br />I'm completely happy with the A6000 and the Tamron 18-200mm.  They do work well together.  I just wanted a little more reach which isn't an affordable option right now for the E-mounts.  I 'm going to add a Sony VCL-2052K, a step down ring, and see what I get."

I come from using Canons for many years, but after two months contemplating the purchase of the Sony, I decided to go ahead and get it... My thinking was I can always sell it if I don't like it.  Now, even after a week's use, you will have to pry this camera out of my cold, dead hands.  It is that good.  My Canon gear will be handed down to my daughter, and I will start to use this camera in all situations.  I have the 18-55, the 55-210, and the Sigma 60mm prime for this camera, all in silver.  Later, I might buy a Yongnuo adapter so I can sneak a Canon lens out of the bag once and a while if I need to.  However, with the 3 lens I have, it all fits into a pretty small bag and the ranges are covered for my every need.  Would I use this camera Professionally?  Absolutely.  It puts my Canon gear to shame in almost every way. I am sure, when the Client sees this diminutive camera, they will think it is a toy.  However, the results will speak for themselves.  The menu system is long and quite involved.  At first, it appeared to me almost incomprehensible, because just about every button can be assigned different functions, plus there are 3 Memories and 2 customizable buttons.  Once you have it set up they way YOU want to shoot, it is all there waiting for you to push the button.  The camera straight out of the box is amazing in itself, but after you twiddle a few dials for your own style of shooting, the camera goes from amazing to awesome.  I do not have one negative thing to say about this camera.  No doubt Sony will come up with an improved model at some date, but what they have produced here is a true winner.  I now understand why many of the recognizable Pro's are going to the mirror-less systems, and Sony in particular.  The price is fantastic for the value received in this little package.

Great portability, reliable focus, excellent focus speed!","First a little background.  I've been using DSLR cameras since 2005, and have owned 4 dslrs and multiple point and shoots.  Then I got a Sony NEX 5n  for the portability factor 3 years ago and loved it, but it didn't have a viewfinder or built in flash.  I spent a lot of money for an add on viewfinder and flash, but on the NEX 5n you could only use the flash OR the viewfinder, but couldn't use both at the same time, because they both hooked into the same accessory port.<br /><br />I purchased the A6000 recently, and it is an ENORMOUS upgrade from NEX 5n.  It has everything I loved about the NEX 5n (a tad bit larger, though) and countless improvements. Its focus is great and it's great for low light shots. My most used lenses are the Sigma 19mm EX DN and the Sigma 30mm EX DN, as well as the Sony 50mm f1.8.  I also have the Sony kit lens from my NEX 5n, which is an 18-55mm, and a Tamron 18-200.  Both of those lenses are &#34;okay&#34;, but not as sharp as the aforementioned.<br /><br />I somewhat miss having the touch screen that the NEX 5n has, but its well worth the trade-off to have the viewfinder and built in flash.  The tiny flash on the A6000 actually does work pretty well for close up shots (5-6 feet away) and I love that it can be held back and made to bounce the light.  I purchased some &#34;bounce cards&#34; inexpensively here on Amazon, that can be slid into the hot shoe mount and they hold the built in flash back for me in the bounce position, so I don't have to hold it back with my finger.  They work great.  I think I will still want to purchase an external flash later on, but the built in flash works well enough that I can hold off on that for awhile.<br /><br />To speed my learning curve, I purchased an interactive video tutorial (How To Unleash The Power Of Your A6000) from Gary Fong dot com for $12.95.  This was a good investment for me in learning the ins and outs of the A6000.<br /><br />This camera will not replace my Canon 70d w/ huge 150-600mm zoom lens, because I still need that for my grandkids' football games, and for shooting birds and wildlife.  For indoor photography or for street photography or museums, the Sony A6000 is just perfect for me.  I would highly recommend it, especially for someone who takes a lot of indoor shots."

I have a Canon 60D and Nikon P7700 and wanted a camera, with at lest an APS-C sensor, that is easy to take everywhere. The A6000 meets all of those criteria and is fun to use. The menu takes a little getting use to and I still haven't figured all of it out yet, but I am having fun learning. The only issues I have with the A6000 is, in my opinion, it should have 2 separate control wheels for aperture and shutter speed. The other is Sony needs to work on their lenses. The kit lens has vignetting when shot at 16 mm as does the 55-210 mm at 55 mm. Both are easily corrected in Lightroom, but you shouldn't have to. I recently purchased an adapter so I could use my old Canon lenses and all i can say is WOW! The images are amazing, sharp, excellent color and no vignetting.

I really can't say how happy i am with this camera.. Thank you Sony... I can't wait for the Sony A7Sii... my brain can't even wrap around what that camera will be able to do in low light.."
Sony,Sony Alpha a7S Mirrorless Digital Camera,20150830,B00JIWXTXG,5,2,2,"on August 30, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Astounding Low-light Performer,"I recently spent three weeks photographing, among other things, interiors of the great cathedrals, palaces, and castles of Spain and Portugal.  I had tackled similar challenges in other countries using other good low-light cameras including the A99.  What the A7S does in dimly lit interiors is, as my title says, astounding.  You can be in a situation that looks gray and shadowy to the point that you can't see much detail or color with the naked eye.  Then you look through the viewfinder on the A7S, and it's like somebody turned on the lights.  The colors come alive, and the details pop out.  Then, the actual shot typically looks even better than the viewfinder image.<br /><br />At one point, my wife and I were looking at a dark interior cathedral wall that contained an elaborate array of organ pipes.  I showed her how it looked on the A7S rear display.  She said, &#34;It looks like a spotlight is shining on it!&#34;<br /><br />To get these effects, I put the ISO on auto and went with shutter priority to allow good hand-held operation.  In that circumstance, the camera is going to go to the largest aperture and set the exposure to look like an illuminated scene.  The images I got in these circumstances had very, very little grain.  As an aside, the camera's noise management (if you choose to shoot jpeg rather than RAW) is superb (and it hasn't always been that way with Sony as I relate later).<br /><br />Another way I used this camera effectively was for indoor candid portraits.  Using HDR, even in backlit situations, most shots came out better than if I'd used flash fill.  I do occasionally use flash, but I never bothered with flash on the S.  Even so, it was comforting to know that I could use a very small flash and get the same results on the S that would require a big honking flash with any other camera.  That high ISO capability has the side benefit of downsizing your flash requirement.  (The 4-stop advantage reduces required flash power by a factor of 16.)<br /><br />In all of my shooting to date, I've yet to see noticeable noise on any shot but one.  That one was made outdoors in the black of night with only a few scattered lights around.  The ISO for that shot was 409,600, and even then the image was dark.  Auto ISO will go that high in pitch black.  In retrospect, I should have tried multi-frame noise reduction to see how much it would have helped.  I'll try doing that and check back later with an update.<br /><br />Another way the A7S high-ISO capability helped out was shooting from a moving platform.  For example, in Seville, we took the classic horse-drawn carriage ride.  The carriage was continuously jerking forward and backward.  I had a zoom lens with built-in stabilization, but the oscillations of the jerking motion were too great for the stabilization to correct.  No problem.  Just crank the ISO way up and shoot with a super high frame rate.  The images came out tack-sharp with no grain at all.  Even when I was just walking outdoors, I tended to set the ISO to 800 minimum.  There was just no point in shooting ISO 100 or 200 unless I wanted a long exposure with short depth of focus.<br /><br />I made heavy use of in-camera HDR on this trip (which isn't available, unfortunately, in RAW).  HDR pushes the exposure in dark areas by shooting multiple shots with varied exposure and superimposing higher exposure in darker areas.  I'm used to seeing grain when I do this with dark scenes.  Again, I saw no grain.<br /><br />I confess to initially being skeptical about the A7S.  In order to have smaller, lighter lenses to go with the A7 line of small, light, mirrorless bodies, Sony went with higher minimum F numbers (e.g., F4 for the 24-70 Zeiss zoom compared to F2.8 for the much bigger Alpha lens).  In addition, Sony did not put optical stabilization in the new FE prime lenses, and my other Sony-Zeiss alpha lenses didn't have it either.  What good was a low light sensor if I forfeited aperture and stabilization, I asked.  The only reason I ended up with an A7S (and some FE lenses) was that my wife wanted to give me something for our 25th anniversary.  I'm now a true believer in the A7S.<br /><br />Sony has now come out with the A7R II.  I'm thinking about getting it as a companion to the S.  I've got the lenses, which are a big part of the expense.  Even with it's backlit sensor, The A7R II can't touch the S when it comes to low light.  Nothing can.  What the A7R II backlit sensor does is help out a lot when you try to make individual sensor detectors very, very small.  The S will benefit proportionately less because of its  larger detectors.  I do shoot a lot of landscapes, and I often need to crop.  That's the only pressing reason for me to go to the A7R II, and even if I had it, I'd stick with the S for most shooting.<br /><br />When people complain about the A7s, they often cite short battery life.  Even an A99 has longer battery life (which says a lot).  What we have to realize is that when we downsize everything we have to pay a price, and not just in lens aperture.  An A99 battery has 150% more weight and volume than an A7s battery, yet the little A7s battery supports the same functionality.  It's no surprise that A7s batteries have relatively short lives.  Unfortunately, the battery size is not reflected in the battery price as much as we might hope.<br /><br />Aside from short battery life (it does come with 2 batteries), I have one other criticism of the A7S design.  The A7S has this ability to go to very high ISO, yet the automatic ISO doesn't seem to take advantage of it unless pushed hard.  For example, I was out today shooting with a 300mm Alpha lens using the LA EA4 adapter.  The program mode set my shutter speed at 320, leaving my ISO at 100.  Now this would be okay if there were some form of stabilization in play, but there was not.  I'm well aware of the old speed versus focal length rule, but, to me, a faster speed would make more sense here.  This camera has ISO to burn, and the automatic ISO selection should, IMHO, take advantage of it.  ***Update:  the A7SII has corrected this with additional flexibility in auto ISO settings.***<br /><br />Another complaint (but not at all from me) is the matter of &#34;lossy&#34; camera RAW.  In my own shots, I have yet to see a recognizable artifact from whatever RAW compression is applied.  I've read the critics comments on this, but I've yet to see an example image from any critic showing a recognizable compression artifact.  I assure you, I can see plenty of artifacts when I use jpeg compression as well as when I apply sharpening.<br /><br />On the subject of sharpening, one of the most critical limitations on sharpening is that it brings out noise.  This is another distinct advantage of the A7S:  noise is extremely low, which allows much more aggressive sharpening.<br /><br />On the subject of jpegs, Sony has, in the past, been rightly criticized for bad application of sharpening and noise reduction.  In the A850/900, the result was a serious noise problem, which drove more people to shoot RAW and do their own noise reduction and sharpening in post.  I have found jpegs from the default settings in the A7s to be extraordinarily clean.  No doubt this is due in part to the low-noise sensor.<br /><br />Speaking of controlling ISO, the Sony manual does a particularly poor job of explaining how to use Auto ISO with control of the maximum and minimum ISO limits.  Here's the sequence:<br />Menu &#62; Camera 4 &#62; ISO &#62; Auto.<br />Now scroll to the right. You'll see the max and min settings appear, which you can select and adjust over the full range of ISO choices.  You don't want to overlook this because this camera is so incredibly capable at high ISO, and, as I've said, the camera tends to be way too conservative in its auto ISO selections.  ***Update:  Again, this was fixed with additional user controllability in the II version.***<br /><br />If you have Sony Alpha lenses that you want to use with the A7s, you'll want to get the LA EA4 adapter.  I have both the EA2 and EA4.  The autofocus tends to hunt very badly with the EA2.  The EA4 essentially turns the camera into an SLT and improves the autofocus performance.  The only downside is loss of one-half stop of exposure.  The A7s autofocuses beautifully with the EA4.<br /><br />As far as video performance goes, I've used it, but not enough to comment.  I did do an in-depth evaluation of the A99 video, which I reviewed as mediocre due primarily to moire problems.  All the professional reviews have praised video performance for the A7s.  They have specifically said there is no moire issue.  Their praise has had only a few caveats.  Perhaps the most significant complaint is rolling-shutter skew.  (A complaint from non-pros is the inability to record 4K video internally.)  Otherwise, the pros are saying it raises the bar for SLR video.<br /><br />So should you buy an A7S or an A7R II?  If I had an A7R II as well, I'd probably use it less than the A7S unless I were only going to shoot outside in the daytime.  What about waiting for an A7S II?  It'll probably have built in stabilization, which certainly would not hurt.  It will probably also record 4K internally.  But it might be correspondingly more expensive as well as slightly larger and slightly heavier with even worse battery life. ***Update:  The A7SII fixes pretty much all of my complaints about the A7S.  But it does cost more.  Based on my own experience, if I were starting from scratch, I'd get the A7SII; but I won't sell my A7S to upgrade.  I'm doing fine without the in-camera stabilization and additional ISO control, but I'd definitely pay more up front to get them.***<br /><br />My bottom line is this:  For me, the A7S is a magical little camera.  It breaks the constraining bonds on low light, sharpening, camera shake, freezing action, and huge flash attachments.  I can do so many things so much easier with it, and I can get some shots that no other camera can touch.  I think it's a breakthrough product."

After seriously setting up the a7s I was shooting some very fine pictures indeed at ISO up to 25,000!! Yes, this camera lives up to its low light high ISO sensitivity reputation. In fact I shoot in aperture mostly and don't pay much attention to the ISO since picture quality is so good. Colour is typically bland &#34;ala Sony&#34; but can be changed according to taste in post processing (in camera also, if you prefer). Surprisingly I quickly got used to the menu (deep and complex) and can navigate with ease. Controls are easier to use than I thought, the Fn5 button is well placed for fast access to the most used settings. Will review more extensively as I make progress with this low light monster and the super Sony Zeiss 55mm f1.8 prime lens I'm currently using (also shot great pics with legacy Nikon manual 200mm f4 macro lens).<br /><br />Caution: no stabilisation; either take care holding camera while shooting or buy stabilised lenses. I have had no problems, after all we never had stabilised cameras in the 35mm film era!<br /><br />Major negative: eats batteries, but I knew that going in. Just buy a set of 2 Vivitar replacement batteries w/charger for $25."

It was returned for a full refund (thank you Amazon).  Advise any buyer of camera equipment to immediately check their purchase to confirm it arrives new if it sold as being such.<br /><br />Aside from the above issue, this is a great bridge camera with best 50X zoom available.  It takes some practice to get best results at the long end of the zoom.  Don't plan on reviewing photos at 100% resolution on your computer because it won't compare well with photos taken with cameras using larger sensors @ 20MP.  Take a look at the review on Imaging Resource for an accurate assessment of this camera.  I have taken photos of subjects, wildlife in particular, that would otherwise be impossible to take up close to the subject.<br /><br />The print quality is very good for average use and even looks great as a wall photo @ 16X20 and acceptable to me @ 20X30 at low ISO settings (less than 400).<br /><br />Other reviewers here on Amazon provide a broad range of assessments but I believe this camera will be very much appreciated by buyers who understand the strength and weaknesses if this product."

We didn't want to make that kind of financial investment, but lets face it sometimes the camera on your phone can't get 'close enough' to the action.  Our requirements were simply-- a good quality camera that had a good zoom (better than a point and shoot) but also could take action shots, maybe some other special shots here or there, etc.<br /><br />My wife/I use our phones primarily for most day-to-day functions.  However we wanted to take special event photos with something that could do better, higher res, better optics, etc.  But we didn't want to go down the rabbit hole of a DSLR-- plus neither of us really know much about things like F-stops and apertures (I took some classes years ago, but I didn't retain much).  So we wanted a bit of a 'dummy proof' option, but that could still have fun in 'manual modes' if we ever wanted to explore.<br /><br />This camera is really nice for all of those ideas above-- it has basic point-to-shoot modes, automatic for just general use.  The next level is to take a photo in a mode (such as firework mode, or similar).  And then from there plenty of manual adjustment modes to play with too!  Sure you are limited to the lens on it, but we have been so thrilled with it thus far.  I'm a huge Sony brand fan, love their interface on the camera and their devices in general.  My only complaint about the camera is the slow render time between photos sometimes.  Otherwise, very pleased and would recommend highly as a really nice bridge camera.<br /><br />EDIT-- Check out more photos taken with this device here in my mini-review:<br />[...]"

I bought this camera because of the 50x zoom, which is very impressive. The camera is easy to use. The menus and options a very user friendly and you don't need to be an expert to use it. It has a build-in user guide if you need help with options. This is not a DSLR camera so don't buy this expecting it to perform like a DSLR. The camera does take great pics and in good lighting it takes some impressive picture. video recorded in 1080p looks crisp. The camera is not very heavy. I can hold it one handed and not feel like I have a brick in my hand.<br /><br />I use this camera primarily to photograph my vacations, outings, family events etc. The 50x zoom has really come in handy. I have used it at the zoo, sporting event and even out deep sea fishing. Using the 50x zoom is great but once you go pass 20x you need very steady hands or a tripod. At 50x zoom the smallest movement made will render the image useless. I find the using the barrel on manual zoom works best at getting less shaky images and video.<br /><br />I have uploaded a short video showing the 50x zoom. The camera was mounted on a flimsy tripod so the video is some what steady. I did not use the barrel to zoom, I used the button so every time I zoomed you could see the camera vibrate.<br /><br />Some may not be happy with the image quality of this camera but I am happy with it.<br /><br />Specs<br /><br />Lens:<br /> Max Aperture f/2.8 - f/6.3<br /> 35mm equivalent 24mm - 1200mm<br /> Optical Zoom 50x<br /><br />Image Sensor:<br /> CCD pixels 20.4Mp (Megapixels)<br /> Pixels (W) 5184<br /> Pixels (H) 3888<br /> Sensor Type Exmor CMOS<br /> Sensor Size 1/2.3 inch<br /><br />Aspect Ratio: 4:3/ 16:9<br /><br />LCD Monitor: 3in<br /> Screen resolution 921,000 dots<br /> No Touch Screen<br />Focusing: Min Focus 1cm, Focusing modes Manual, Spot, Face Detection, Multi, Center<br /><br />Recording modes:Easy, Intelligent Auto, Superior Auto, Program, Manual, Aperture-priority, Shutter speed-priority, Memory Recall, 3D Still Image, SCN, Intelligent Sweep Panorama, Movie<br /><br />ISO sensitivity: ISO 80 to ISO 12800<br /><br />White balance: Auto, Daylight, Cloudy, Fluorescent white, Fluorescent natural white, Fluorescent day white, Incandescent, Flash, Custom<br /><br />Shooting Options: Continuous shooting 10fps,Movie mode<br />Video Resolution 1920x1080, 1280x720 720p, 640x480 VGA<br />Video FPS 60<br />Stereo Sound Yes<br />Optical Zoom with Video<br /><br />Image Stabilisation Yes<br />Interface: HDMI, USB, USB 2<br />No Wi-Fi<br />No GPS<br />Storage: SD/SDHC/SDXC; Memory Stick Pro Duo<br /><br />File Type: JPEG/AVCHD (MTS); MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 (MP4)<br /><br />Power Source: LITHIUM ION NP-BX1 3.6V<br /><br />Box Contents: Rechargeable Battery Pack NP-BX1, Shoulder Strap, AC AdaptorAC-UB10, Lens Cap, Micro USB cable, Instruction Manual<br />Dimensions<br />Weight 650g<br />Width 129.6mm<br />Height 93.2mm<br />Depth 103.2mm"

Upon receipt, I immediately started using it and I found it much better simpler to use.  It is more than a point and shoot and acts like my Nikkon except that I can't change lenses (a plus?).  Taking it on a trip is much lighter and the zoom is fantastic.  No changing lenses to achieve the same result.  There is no shoe for an external flash, the only drawback for me.  It does require some knowledge of changing aperture, ISO, etc., so you get the feel of a full SLR.  I am very pleased with this camera, although I am still learning how to use its features."

Sony Cybershot is still the best!,"This camera is as close to a DSLR as you can get without purchasing a DSLR.  I had an HX100 previously and purchased an affordable DSLR to replace it.  I learned quickly how much my Sony Cybershot HX100 had spoiled me. I sold the DSLR and upgraded to this newer version of what I had.  One of my most favorite features is snapping pictures WHILE I am videoing.  That is an awesome irreplaceable feature.  What's more is it has been a great solution to low lighting problems like taking pictures of my daughter in a gym for gymnastics.  When you snap pictures while it is recording a video they are significantly lighter and it captures great action shots.  Many times I have had a video recording and just snap pictures back to back so later I can check to see which ones came out perfect for least blurry action shots.  But the lighting is always better taken during the video in low lighting.  The perk of this one versus my HX100 is 50x zoom - wow!!  You can't beat that in itself for the price!  People have mentioned on here that getting a lens that would even nearly touch that zoom would be an astronomical cost on a DSLR.  I had purchased the Samsung NX2000 and the zoom was awful.  I learned to get a better zoom I would have to buy another lens other than the one it came with and that was an added cost of $200.  This wonderful camera is a nice bundle of perfect photography abilities for our family!! Also love the added two picture effects.  The one I remember, that I'm using and love is &#34;illustration&#34;.  We have a boxer mix and I change some of hers to illustration and she looks just like a cartoon dog.  LOVE IT!!"

I will update this review if things change.  I bought this item used and the shipper had put it in a box a quarter of an inch too small to contain it.  Thus I received a box with a dome-like bulge on one end of it, where the retracted lens was pushing up.  Yikes!  Seems however that Santa's little packages flew so fast on their reindeer that no boxed item had a chance to be up against another one long enough to receive any damaging pressure this Christmas.  Merry-merry to me.  Good thing.  :)"
