To be honest and to give you my prospective, My main camera is a Nikon D800e, so I'm use to very nice images.  I bought this camera for travel since it is a lot less expensive, smaller and lighter.  Other than being less expensive, smaller and lighter I see no benefits to this camera.  My first disappointment was its lack of configuration.  If you shoot in auto mode then you will be shooting in JPG only.  In the other modes you can configure for RAW file format but the RAW file format used by Fuji is not supported by Adobe Lightroom.  You have to run them through a converter.  The lowest ISO you can choose in any of the menus is 200.  The lens that comes with it has an aperture that will only open to 3.5 so don't plan on getting any bokeh your shots.  And if you want a better lens expect to pay about $700+ for it.  Also, when you use the camera on a tripod or a strap that attaches to the tripod threads on the bottom you will not have access to your SD card or Battery.  You can't charge the battery in the camera, you have to remove it, put it in the charger and plug it in.  The image quality is slightly better than a point and shoot camera, but I've seen my wife take better pictures with her iPhone.  I would not buy this camera again."

You can play with all number of settings in manual modes, or let the camera do the work for you in a few different auto modes.  Buttons are fairly instinctive and nicely placed, reading the manual, as usual, will help you learn what all the dials can do for you in each mode.  The camera with this kit lens isn't too heavy, I was able to carry it around on a neck strap tooling around town for many hours.  While this isn't the greatest lens in the world, it will let you start to play and you'll hone some skills before dropping some serious cash on a lens that suits exactly what style of photography you want to delve into.  I'm happy using this lens for general purpose, still better photographs than with my smart phone.  The camera size lends it to being carried around in a smaller camera bag, this is nice given the massive variety of bag options available that fit this camera."

Seriously,"Super slow when changing settings in the Adv. mode to SP mode.  expect about a 5 sec delay.  Hence, alot of lost shots because camera processor must be super old as I was using a 64GB SDXC card.  Hence, all this camera is is a sunny day camera for use on long shots.  Also, when shooting in the movie mode, the microphone records the sound of the zoom motor - Zooming!  Shutter lag, depends on the lighting.  But, as noted on the lens 4.3-6.5 reeks a seriously slow lens in low light.  So think of it as a joke as there are Fuji camera similar to this one priced at about $175.  Funny, none of the other reviewers noted about the zoom motor.  And added surprise by Fuji."

They turn out really clear and vintage-like, they are so cool! It is aso really nice to have the pictures print out right away, it usually takes a few minutes to totally show up.  The frames even come in cute colors and patterns, but i prefer white because it gives it a more sophisticated look.  Unless you are a big fan of pink, I wouldnt recommend buying this camera in that color... it looks different than it does online and gets dirty fast.  also be careful not to expose new, unused film to light, because it will ruin the film and when you try to take pictures with it it wont show up.

It's very cute and super portable. The camera comes equipped with different shooting modes depending on what the lighting is, and the indicator light will tell you which mode it believes you should be in. This is just a plain point and shoot. There are no fancy settings to let you zoom or anything, you pretty much get what you get with this. It comes with an arm strap which is actually very handy and convenient. However, the film is super pricey. Additionally, I wouldn't change out of the original setting when shooting because everytime I put it on the setting it suggests the picture comes out awful. It's very tricky to figure out how to take a picture only because the circle of focus, isn't what the camera focuses on once you take the picture, so honestly it's a guessing game when taking a picture up close. Pictures taking at a distance are a lot easier to take. Also, if you get too close to a subject, and I mean within like 1.5 feet, the whole picture basically comes out white because the flash is so intense. Also, if you are outside and it is super sunny and you put the mode on the sun, the picture just comes out with a white glow on it, if it is cloudy and the camera suggests you use the cloudy setting, the picture comes out a black hazy blob. However, once you work out the kinks and get to know the camera I think it's very neat and I prefer to use it over my 6plus"

For our wedding, we used an instant printer and the quality was just not great so we were diappointed.

The time between shots is less than 15 seconds, so our event planners were able to go around and take pictures of all our guests at the party.<br />The only downside was that when pictures were taken in extreme sunlight, the quality looked somewhat washed out.  The built-in flash did better than expected and indoor photos looked perfect."

Its a bulbously looking camera, kinda playful, but everywhere you go with it people look. I love the reaction from waiters who we ask to take a picture for us - they always get really excited and loop back after a few minutes just to see how the picture turned out. Obviously it is a basic camera - you can only pick the ISO and the camera gives you a suggested number depending on light levels it detects, and you select the level by rotating the ring around the lens. Obviously you cant change aperture or shutter speet and you cant zoom - but thats beside the point, its a polaroid! The viewfinder is slightly off target but we have gotten used it it after a few shots. The flash is super bright so we put white cloth medical tape on it to diffuse the light, which works well. Also obviously in low light its not that great and the flash ALWAYS fires (cant turn it off) so watch out for whitewashing your subject and having black behind them - cover the flash a bit or have a light source behind you. In the same way, at night it cannot pick up buildings or fountains behind you if theyre more than 5-10 feet away. Daytime shooting in parks and streets is great. I havent tried the macro (zoom) mode yet bc I didnt want to waste any shots on things like food, but Id imagine that would be the only way to manually change the aperture so you could get that nice blurry background behind the subject. Maybe I'll try and report back."

First of all, get amazon prime, quickest shipping ever. Second, I love love love the camera! It's not too bulky or too large for me to use one handed (mind you I have really small hands). The shutter button is located on the left side of the camera and the settings are turn-to based- meaning you turn the lens to the setting that best suits your situation. It takes double AA batteries which isn't too bad, better than some other models and it also includes a wrist strap. Third, make sure you purchase instant film, lots of it because you'll want to just snap snap snap at everything.

This camera takes pictures very quickly, and we haven't had a blurry one yet. Plus, she is mesmerized by seeing the picture come out of the camera. I can't wait until she is a little older, and can take some pictures with it herself.<br />In an age of photos that live on hard drives, there is just something so fun about having your picture instantly.

Films are cheaper than old polariod cameras.  Only problem is that view finder doesn't match what you need to capture.  You have to guesstimate and hope it turns out good but it's good for selfies, even though I'm not all caught up with the whole selfie thing.  I believe an awesome photographer won't sink to that level .  The other problem is when you set it to the right environment light  for oustide, the background is completely black.  So just leave it for indoor setting.  I wished I had purchased the black edition instead of the whiet because there's more visible dirt.  Either than that the camera is pretty awesome to take that old school polariod shots."

They refills of film are kind of pricey but this would make a cute gift for a graduate or newly married couple and if your okay with spending 100 bucks on film, fun for a party. The pictures come out just like polaroid's do, so I'm not sure they've improved on color quality.  Picture quality as far as sharpness does look better than some polaroid's I've seen. I'm going to say I like it with four stars instead of loving it just because of the price point on film and the lack of improvement on color.  My first time using it was a little clunky, but I'm someone who like to dive in and see if I can figure out a product before I read the directions. Loading the film was a no brainer but if you aren't tech or camera savvy, take a moment to read the directions before using."

I took it to a wedding and it was a huge hit! Everyone wanted to have their picture taken with it! I also like how it has the lighting options for different locations, though I haven't quite figured out the best way to gauge the light myself. The picture quality is great at night and indoors. I have had some hit or miss results with outdoor, super-sunny pictures, but I'm not sure if that is user error or just that the camera isn't ideal for these types of shots. I'll have to play with it more to figure it out. The pictures are also a really great size - small and narrow - a lot of people commented on how much they liked the actual shape and size of the picture. An obvious and expected complaint: the film is too expensive. But that is just something you have to live with if you want to take instant pictures I guess. One comment on the color - I bought the yellow one and really like it. It's more of a pastel color - think yellow post-it note or a pastel lemon."

Fujifilm,Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Raspberry),20130723,B00U2UZ40Y,5,1,340,"on July 23, 2013",ANONYMOUS,Instax Facts,"I looked for a reliable, classy-looking Polaroid camera as a wedding reception guest book. After thorough research, I determined Instax was cheaper and just as reliable, if not more, than the new Polaroid instant cameras. Both cameras function similarly and use the same film; yet Instax has better reviews and is cheaper. The 8S has a few extra bells and whistles: a clip-on lens for close-up pictures, light/dark and indoor/outdoor settings, the mirror on the front of the camera, and two shutter buttons for either landscape or portrait photographs. Also, the lithium batteries are not hard to find for sale online; I haven't had to replace ours yet, but we know that availability and price would afford on inconvenience.<br /> I have loved it; it was perfect for the party and I still use it frequently. The film is fairly inexpensive, so we continue to use it. The pictures are the size of a credit card with white borders, and the camera comfortably fits in a small purse. On our honeymoon, the good quality allowed us to take pictures of us in front of landmarks and beautiful areas. Also, a little mirror resides on the front of the camera to facilitate quick self-portraits, which can be taped later into journals as keepsakes. Learning which lighting settings work best in certain conditions took some trial and error, but every picture turned out vintage-y and fun, so no film was wasted.<br />One last word on durability: I didn't have the wrist strap around my arm and accidentally dropped the camera on a ceramic-tiled floor. The film flew out of the back of the camera, but nothing broke off or dented. The camera still looks great and functions optimally, and I only lost the top film, the rest of the cartridge still printed great pictures. That was a while ago, and I haven't had any problems at all!"

It's fun as a scrapbook or travel journal camera and the pictures were pretty clear. Minimal settings so you just point and shoot. One of the bad things is there is no timer and taking 'selifes' or close-ups takes some practice because the viewfinder is off from the actual lens.

I was sort of apprehensive about buying it after reading some of the reviews that talked about the small picture size and clarity. I also wondered how much money we would end up spending on film because of his desire to take pictures of EVERYTHING. His cell phone already has a camera, so why have another camera to carry around that will produce pictures that will ultimately lay around the house or end up in a drawer? After all of my doubts, this turned out to be a great gift. My son is very selective about what he shoots and the pictures are no smaller than expected. There hasn't been a problem with the clarity of the pictures that wasn't a result of user error. The kids all love it!

When the second camera arrived, the brightness dial was already broken when I took it out of the box.  So at this point, I've wasted about $20 worth of film and quite a bit of time for nothing.

And you always get the 'wow' factor when you snap an instant shot on a night out.<br />I would definitely recommend this product!"

It is really easy to operate. I wanted it because of the view-finder. I also like that it has more zoom than similarly priced cameras. I need a camera that you can really hold onto and keeps my fingers out of the lens - this does that beautifully. I especially like that the camera kicks its lens cover off when you turn it on - how handy is that??? Good thing my husband automatically attached the lens cover with the string provided so I don't have to go searching for it when it pops off the lens.

The camera is very easy to get to know and the pictures have been nothing short of stunning.

It was a shot that should have been great but was not (because of the very old/bad camera) that finally spurred me into seeking out a good camera. I read reviews and decided on this one. I have been very satisfied with the camera and it made me really love taking pictures which in turn started me down the road to getting an even better camera-but that's another story. This camera is pretty easy to use and it has a fair amount of manual settings. Some people call these type of point and shoot cameras a 'bridge camera' because it is a step up from the simple digital cameras but not quite a dslr. I personally always think of it as a 'gateway camera' as in gateway drug because it awakened the sleeping photography addict within! You can get as involved in the process as you want; or not since it also has an automatic setting which figures it all out for you, and a scene selection setting in which you choose what type of picture you want to take- portrait, landscape, flower etc. The zoom is fantastic and if you have steady hands your pictures will turn out crisp. I was thanking my good fortune this past spring when my son graduated high school in a rather large venue. We were seated very far away and I was still able to get some very good shots. The ones that were not good were my fault- shaky hands! The picture quality and color are also wonderful. About the time I got this camera I also got some photo editing software. One thing I have noted about this camera was that the color balance rarely needed adustment- it was usually dead on. So, if you want to take beautiful crisp pictures with true colors and you are not ready to take that leap into the world of dslr-this is the camera for you"

This is not the camera's issue it was mine. I learned to adjust the settings and the next time I attended a concert and the artist was even farther away, the pictures turned out really great! I owned a Fuji S3200 which was by far a better camera and unfortunately it was stolen. The comparison is not fair. The optical zoom on the S2940 is good, but I miss the digital zoom feature of my old camera. For the money though, this is an outstanding camera and reading the manual is imperative to take awesome pictures. Video turned out good too.

The product is OK, it is what you can expect from an instant film camera. But mine looks really old, like it had been stored for 7 years or more, it has some pen marks and it has some dust. When I rotate the focus lens it sounds like it has some dust and is rusty inside, pretty much like having a chicken inside it. Also the box looks like used, it came with some hair strings inside it and finally there is a label over and old label, so it seems like it was reselled. Completely not a new item."

My only negative with this camera is that the capture button is in an awkward spot on the front of the camera, so I can see how it would be easy to accidentally take pictures. This did not come with film, so I purchased separately. You can buy it in packs of 50 photos for about $37.

I recently went down the shore and when I tried to use the camera (on the brightest sun setting) to take pictures of the sand dunes, the pictures came out WAY overexposed. It made me waste about 4 films out of 10. The only time it worked was if I was taking a photo of someone DIRECTLY in front of me.

This camera instantly prints out pictures (about the size of a credit card) using film and runs on two AA batteries as its power source.

The Good: Excellent price, Easy setup, LOTS of vintage fun! The Bad: The suggested light setting indicator can sometimes be inaccurate, leading to washed out pictures (you'll figure out which setting works best with practice, so don't rely too much on the suggestions).
