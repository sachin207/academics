Posting a review of the G3 now that the G5 is out probably seems pretty pointless. So why am I bothering? Because the G3 is still available and has almost all the features of the G5. In fact, they're virtually identical. As I write this, the kit price of the G3 is down to $499, $300 less than the G5... Get a G3 while you can and you won't be sorry!!<br /><br />Either way you go, G3 or G5, the camera is such a treat. I got the 45-200mm lens to compliment the kit lens and I've had great fun with it. We're now thinking of vacations in terms of photo tours, and with tools like Ligntroom 4 or Photoshop Elements 10, you can spend hours creatively putting together journals of memories with photo quality that is fantastic.<br /><br />I'd recommend a couple of inexpensive extras. First, macro extension tubes for extreme close-ups. About $12. Also get a UV filter mostly to protect the lens, and a circular polarizing filter. And extra batteries. The battery life is pretty slim between charges. I ordered the Wasabi set with 2 batteries and a charger for about 30 bucks. Works perfectly. Finally, get a decent camera bag (I personally prefer a sling-type)."

I just have fun with it.,"First of all, I'm not a professional photographer, I just like to take pictures of people and places. This camera is not a full DSLR but it is way better than that point and shoot that you've been using. Anyone can review a camera, but only you can determine what fits your needs and desires.<br /><br />Many years ago, I had a Canon AE-1. I used that camera until it finally wore out.  That camera was perfect for me, with it's focus assist.  It gave me some great pictures of our trips and later the kids as babies.  Then the digital age started and I bought one point and shoot after another but was never happy with the results, though it was nice to not have to spend money on bad pictures. Continuously searching I never found a great camera. A few months ago  I sensed that It was time to upgrade again,  DSLR's were still too big and way too expensive. However, point and shoots weren't giving me the flexibility I wanted nor the results I needed. Then I happened upon the micro 4/3 system.  Smaller than a full sized DSLR but with many of the features.  I spent an enormous time researching this camera and others like it.  After reading all about it, I was able to play around with at a several cameras at Best Buy.  Once I had it in my hand I knew it was the right camera for me.  It's about the size of my old SLR with some cool tricks up its sleeve.<br /><br />First of all, I liked the price. More than I would have spent on a point and shoot, but no DSLR comes close to the price range. Since Panasonic has come out with a newer model the price is even better. However, because there is a newer model, this model may be difficult to find in a brick and mortar anymore.<br /><br />2nd - I liked the size.  The Sony may have better results in low light, but the camera body was smaller than the lens and felt awkward. The Nikon has a feature that you can shoot video and stills at the same time, but I didn't like the menu and it didn't feel right.  Besides the ads disgusted me.<br /><br />3rd- I liked the interchangeable lens.  So far I just have the kit lens, but am already researching a second fixed lens for indoor low light with small aperture settings, and for portraits. The kits lens takes great pictures but I just want to have options.<br /><br />4th- As soon as I picked it up and turned it on in the store, I noticed the ease of use. If it's too complicated you just won't use it.  I will admit going online to get help setting the camera up at first, and finding my way through the menus but after that I think the menu system is easy to figure out.<br /><br />Finally I really loved the swivel LCD touch screen (not available on the newer model) and the focusing system. I recommending watching the video on the Panasonic website.  There are also several youtube videos out there. The touch screen is responsive,  and the pinpoint focus is fast and gives amazing detail even when using the kit lens for macro photography.<br /><br />Overall, the camera is a great size, is flexible and comes at a price point you may be willing to handle,  Most importantly it takes great photos.  I love capturing memories and seeing what I can create with it.  Isn't that really why we take pictures to begin with?  This camera will just make it fun, and give you better results than your point and shoot or cell phone and its just as easy to use."

The body is only a little bigger than many point and shoot cameras and it weighs next to nothing. Even with the kit lens attached it's smaller and lighter than my old Canon superzoom.<br /><br />While the kit lens has a relatively small zoom (the 14-42mm equates to 28mm to 84mm in 35mm terms) the 16 megapixels give you a lot of room to crop without significantly damaging print quality.<br /><br />Speaking of the kit lens, I really like it. It's a manual zoom, which I find very flexible and the traditional focusing ring is sensitive enough that I found manual focusing easy. The lens has built in image stabilization so even when hand holding at longer exposures there's very little blur.<br /><br />While it's not perfect for everything the kit lens gives you a pretty good range from landscape to portrait. And if it's not a full on macro lens, it doesn't do too badly there either.<br /><br />Image quality is great and the large sensor, when compared to a point and shoot, means it handles low light shooting pretty well too. Within reason.<br /><br />Other nice features include the fully articulated LCD touch screen which makes it easy to take photos from odd angles or to quickly focus on a particular subject. The viewfinder is nice too. No it's not optical (this is a micro 4/3rds after all) but it's a large LCD viewfinder which makes it very easy to see details as you're composing your shot.<br /><br />But my favorite is actually the speed the camera turns on. Quite literally if you turn it on and raise it to your eyes, it will be ready to go. No more missed shots, waiting for the camera to get going!<br /><br />There are of course better cameras out there. But you can't get them for less than $600. This makes the perfect starter camera for people who want to move from point and shoots into the SLR world."

It has a great deal going for it. Like, for instance, you can set it to Automatic (idiot) mode with a push of a button wherever you happen to be on the dial, and there's more. Unlike with most cameras, with the G3 you can set the camera to a super-auto mode (via the menus), which allows you to tweak three aspects of the auto mode, viz. exposure compensation, white balance (warmer or colder), and depth of field. This is great, though when you switch out and back into this mode, you have to reset any changes you've made: it goes back to the default settings.<br /><br />Also very positive is the articulating screen, which makes getting flower shots from ground level very easy. So again, another facility that really makes this camera a delight to use.<br /><br />Image quality isn't as good as my Canon S90. I know the cameras can't really be compared, but truth is, the S90 is a compact, fixed lens camera, which I carry around with me when I'm using the G3, so I get to compare similar shots all the time. The S90 is sharper, often gets a better colour balance, and has a superior screen. It doesn't have an electronic viewfinder, and you can't change lenses. The S90, and its successors the S95 and S100, are also a lot cheaper than the G3.<br /><br />I'm just about happy with the image quality, but know for sure that if I want the best images, I would spend my money on a DSLR like the Nikon D5100, which is a $100 more expensive, but in a different world in terms of speed, ease of use, ergonomics, build quality, viewfinder, battery life, and just about everything else I can think of, except weight.<br /><br />There are some negatives beyond slight reservations about image quality. Like, for instance, the fact that the lenses have an excellent manual focus ring, but -- and this is such a big but! -- you have to dive into menus to shift into manual focus. Ridiculous. You're lying on the ground trying to get a dynamic flower shot; the auto-focus is driving you crazy; so you have to dig into menus to get manual control. This is where we go back to a DSLR, which might even be the same price as the G3, but has the intelligence to give you the switch on the lens or camera. There are other important functions buried in menus, which always irritates me.<br /><br />If you want to use exposure compensation you have to click the rear wheel (not totally pleasant for my fingers), then rotate it. To clear the viewfinder icon that comes up, you click the wheel again, which brings up depth of field tweaking, then click again. Three clicks to cycle through. I find this fiddly and ergonomically a bit lacking. It's also pretty easy to change depth of field by mistake, and vice versa.<br /><br />My main concern is that very portable cameras like the S90, S95, and S100 get better image quality, and if you want a serious camera, for the same money or a little more you buy an entry-level DSLR. These are real cameras for people who know photography. Just little details, a certain fiddliness, the diluted image quality, lack of easy switching to manual focus, the limitations of an electronic view finder, the fact that the screen doesn't dim when you raise the camera to your eye, and other niggling details make me wonder exactly where the G3 fits in and whether it's worth its fairly high price tag.<br /><br />It is light, and when you buy the longer zoom you have an amazingly portable package. That's why I'm hanging onto it. When I fly cheaply I can take little baggage, and this saves on weight in a big way.<br /><br />UPDATE (25 June 2012): I should add that the battery life on this camera is about as bad as I have found. I don't use the LCD screen much and I do little reviewing of my snaps, yet I still get fewer than 120 shots per Panasonic battery (I'd say this battery has been discharged around 25 times). If I did a lot of reviewing this would probably fall to 90. A third-part battery manages about two thirds of this. My Nikon D7000 is at least eight times better in terms of battery life.<br /><br />If you're buying this camera, add two or three batteries to your purchase."

I spent literal weeks annoying my wife and giving myself migraines by comparing all the different kinds of cameras on the market. I'm an amateur, so my priority with photography is having a camera that gives me the simplicity I need now with the potential for greater control down the road. With this in mind I narrowed down my choices to a few camera classes: the Micro 4/3s, Sony NEX's, and enthusiast P+S.<br /><br />Very difficult to only pick one of these. If money was no issue, I'd get at least one interchangeable lens system and one P+S. But alas, money is always a primary factor in these things so I had to make a decision about what was most important to me: picture quality & versatility or portability? After much mental exercise, I decided that having a versatile and high quality camera was more important than something that could fit in my pocket. So that eliminated the Olympux XZ-1 and Canon Powershot S100 that I had been considering (though I'd still love an XZ-1 one of these days).<br /><br />The second decision was far more difficult. Micro 4/3s or Sony NEX? The Sony NEX series is the most popular on Amazon and has all sorts of hype around it. It's so slim, it looks cool, it has that huge APS sensor, etc etc. And in the Micro 4/3s class, there are so many more affordable options and way more lenses available (and let's be honest, glass is a huge element in taking good photos). While I've wanted a Sony NEX since it was first introduced, I actually started leaning towards the Panasonic G3 when put side by side in my comparisons. What really intrigued me about this camera was that it had all the DSLR features built in already and even resembled a DSLR, but at about half the size and weight, and at a pricepoint that was much more agreeable than competing models without those features. No, it didn't have the supermodel body of the Sony NEX, but seemed quite a bit more practical. Personally, I am not always going to remember to bring a detachable flash with me when I take my camera out on trips. Nor am I going to feel excited about spending $200 or $300 on a separate viewfinder that I also need to keep track of. The G3 integrates these basic (and in my mind, essential) functions into the camera body, eliminating the possibility of someone absent-minded like me forgetting items at home... or worse, on the road.<br /><br />The other thing that made the G3 rise to the top of my list was the swivel LCD screen. While the Sony NEX-5N has the articulating screen, I find the G3's screen with its full range of motion to be significantly better. I prefer the screen being off to the side so that my hand holding the camera doesn't interfere with my view of the screen, especially if I'm holding it way above my head. Both cameras can achieve the same kinds of photos, but the G3 makes it easier. The EVF on the G3 is also pretty good. It's a lot easier to adjust menu settings on the LCD, but the EVF controls are sufficient for most things I want to do, and I find myself using the EVF just as much if not more than the LCD for composing shots.<br /><br />So anyways, I ended up getting the G3 (obviously). I've only had it for a few days and still learning the basic modes and settings, but I can say pretty definitively that it takes excellent photos, gives me the fast autofocus and blurred backgrounds I was craving, is extremely well constructed and feels great in the hand, and is just a pleasure to use. The included zoom lens is not that fantastic, but it's a good enough starter lens for someone like me. With a 32GB SDHC card installed I can take 1,141 photos in combined RAW+Fine mode which is more than I'll ever need in one day. Well, who knows - I am traveling to Yellowstone soon :)<br /><br />PS: Definitely keep your eye on the price of this camera as it dropped twice within a week from the date I purchased it.<br /><br />EDIT 5/10/12: After a few hundred shots in different conditions I've learned a few extra things I wanted to share. The main thing I've noticed is that in low light, indoor situations, the iAuto mode will not raise the ISO sufficiently to capture the shot. It seems to always want to shoot at 800 during the night, so I find myself switching into Program mode and changing ISO to 1600. It makes a tremendous difference. Noise is completely absent from these shots too. Another thing I've had to change is the behavior of the manual focus ring in different record modes. It's called MF Assist, and if you start adjusting the manual focus ring on the zoom lens when in MF mode, it will zoom in on the area you're pointing at on your LCD or EVF. This makes it very difficult to compose a shot, because now all you can see is a fuzzy square in the middle of your screen resulting from that digital zoom. I promptly turned this feature off after missing a few great photo opportunities while in MF mode - I have no idea where this would ever come in useful. One last thing, the delay when recording an image in RAW+Fine mode is substantial, so I would go to only Fine or only RAW mode when you are doing any kind of action shots, even some photo shoots. Maybe I'm just impatient, but a few seconds can mean the difference between THE shot and a throwaway shot.<br /><br />That's it for now - all in all I am still enamored with this camera. Because of the inadequate ISO in iAuto mode in low light, I'm pretty much staying in Program mode these days, with white balance set to Auto and ISO manually adjusted based on what I'm shooting. It didn't take long to figure out how to cycle between these settings quickly, another reason I love having the manual mode dial on the camera body."

My son just started playing little league and not only was the S60 not performing but the video from the Sony was really disappointing. It was also a pain dragging both cameras to the games and constantly switching back and forth.<br /><br />I've always wanted to get more into photography but wanted something smaller than the typical DSLR. I also wanted a camera that would take decent HD video in one package. The G3 has been well reviewed and has a few active usergroups out there on the interwebs. The micro 4/3 system now has a nice family of lenses to choose from and can be adapted to most heritage systems from Canon and Nikon. I got the G3 with kit lens and the 45-200mm telephoto. Both arrived the same day in the same box, well packaged and on time. It was clear right away that I had my first real camera... the pictures are stunning and the video is breathtaking.....all in the hands of an enthusiast/amateur. This camera inspires me!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- small and lightweight. It won't fit in your pocket, but it's small enough that you will forget it's there.<br />- good feel/grip when hand holding<br />- full range of control from complete auto to full manual...perfect for upgrade from point and shoot camera for those who want to do more with their camera<br />- take movies from any mode/settings by pushing record button. Movie mode is more or less full auto... which I like since I'm not into videography and just want great home movies.<br />- take pictures while recording movies<br />- intuitive menu system<br />- touchscreen is very useful and surprisingly effective<br />- autofocus is fast and accurate. very cool touch to focus while taking movies or touch to focus/take shot in picture mode.<br />- manual focus is fun and effective with MF assist.<br />- Mega OIS (image stabilization on the 45-200mm) is really nice. note all Panny lumix lenses have OIS in the lens if at all.<br />- bundled software (especially sikypix) actually useful<br />- great family of lenses to choose from<br />- perfect for shooting my son's baseball games!<br />- great high ISO performance up to about 1600.<br />- great resolution at 16MP<br />- built-in electronic viewfinder is really nice. can't imagine buying a competitor's camera without a viewfinder.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- kit lens is slow (ie, you will need flash for most low light/ indoor shots...typical for kit lenses from any brand)<br />- good lenses tend to be very pricey<br />- as with all DSLR type cameras, movies can exhibit 'jello effect' if there is excessive camera movement.  This isn't too hard to avoid... and forces you to learn to move slowly while taking video which results in better videos anyway.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking to upgrade from a P&S like I did. You will love it. Consider buying a second lens along with the kit depending on what you typically shoot. The kit is good for general all-purpose stuff. I love my 45-200mm... it was a real bargain and is AWESOME for  reaching out to fill the frame with my son from 100ft away or more.<br /><br />From other reviews here and elsewhere, more experienced photographers also seem to be pleased with the G3 for its small size and versatility. But don't take my word for it, read for yourself."

In the last decade complemented with a compact digital, Canon G series. Good as far as compactness and user control - but limited because of the small sensor size.<br />I live in Argentina, where the HW is more expensive than for you guys in the US. After years watching the technology development and pondering alternatives, a few months ago finally made the move to a system digital camera: a Panasonic G3 with the standard kit zoom.<br />My experience:<br />The G3 is good: lightweight, nice electronic through the lens view, nearly instantenous shots, good controls. Any old SLR user will feel comfortable.<br />ISO 800 images are almost as good as ISO 160, unless you look very, very closely at a large print.<br />The included flash is OK to fill-in purposes.<br />Replacement batteries costing a fraction of the original ones work fine.<br />Jpgs out of the camera are good, but RAWs processed with default settings on the provided Silkypix SW are better. And if you have the time, read carefully the Silkypix help file, a lot of power is hidden in there.<br />The kit lens is OK, but not great in terms of resolution.<br />I bought an inexpensive Fotodiox adapter MD-to-micro 4/3 to use my 30+ years old Minolta lenses.<br />The MD-Rokkor 100 mm F/2.5 makes wonders on the G3: great resolution, nice bokeh, lots of light gathering. Of course autofocus and antishake are gone. The comparision is not quite fair, but it equals a 200mm in terms of full size 35mm. In the real full size sensor world, it would take a Nikon 200mm f/2 with a list price of $ 5.999,95 to have the equivalent...<br />As I do flowers photos, am considering to add the highly regarded panasonic macro 45mm f/2.8 ($ 600). In the meantime, i put to work another oldie, the MD-Rokkor 35mm f/2.8 on a set of m4/3 extension rings, with great results for macro work. And by the way, the 35mm makes an ultrasharp short telephoto lens, two f-stops brighter than the zoom kit lens.<br />To carry all the gear, i use a small camera bag, and also bought a flexible Fotodiox neoprene sleeve for the camera alone. Funny, but fills its purpose.<br />IMHO, very few amateurs do need a larger sensor: today, for practically every system camera in basic configuration, the bottleneck is the lens.<br />Panasonic and Olympus bet on micro 4/3. Nikon and Canon instead care for their formerly analog large customer bases... in a few years we'll know who is Betamax."

This is still a tough nut to crack for any camera within the lower consumer price arena.<br />I love the touch screen feature and the swivel screen.  It makes taking pictures of oneself (and a friend ;)) a whole lot easier!  It also has a screen touch shutter.  This feature allows you to touch on the screen where you want to focus.. once you touch the screen you depress the shutter!

I have a Canon T2i (which has an excellent sensor from the 7d) and I find the Panny, which weighs half as much, will take better pictures in a lot of situations. A good place to compare images close-up is the Comparometer on the Imaging Resources site.<br /><br />2) The 14-42 kit lens is definitely inferior to 14-45 lens that was bundled with the G1 and G2. I'd encourage people to just buy the body and then get the 14-45. The 14-45 performs uncommonly well without any need for post-processing because lens correction is built into the camera software.<br /><br />3) For HDR enthusiasts the Panny G series is a favorite because it can autobracket 7 exposures (Nikon and Canon only build that into their super-expensive professional DSLRs) One of the improvements in the G3 is a wider autobracketing exposure range.<br /><br />4) This is a great learning camera because it does a super job on automatic settings.

Its a catch 22 because the M4/3 mirror-less standard was designed to reduce the camera package size, yet the addition of a viewfinder now makes the camera larger. However, as I quickly learned, a viewfinder is critical for bright outdoor photography.  I haven't seen a LCD screen on a camera yet that works great in bright sun. A viewfinder is better.<br /><br />When the G3 was released I was pleased to see that Panasonic focused on all the right things.  Image quality, articulating screen, viewfinder, and simple effective controls.  The final 'icing on the cake' was the reduced camera size compared to previous models with built-in viewfinders. The G3 is not much bigger than the GF2, in fact it feels like the GF2 with a really good viewfinder attached to it. In fact it still fits in my GF2 camera bag, a bit snug but it fits. Bottom line is that the G3 is still way smaller than a large bulky DSLR.<br /><br />I highly recommend upgrading to the G3 if you have a non-viewfinder M4/3 system."

At this time, I own six digital cameras, three  Olympus, one  Fuji, one Canon and the Panasonic G3. The G3 is the best in terms of image quality and color. It is an excellent tool for my kind of photography. By my kind, I mean slow, careful nature photography almost always using a tripod. I shoot aperture priority, with the smallest possible aperture and a long shutter speed. I also do a little bird photography, with the Olympus 70-300mm lens (using an adapter on the G3).<br /><br />Many reviews of this camera have been negative about the 14-42mm lens, which is described as soft. This is not true, at least if you stop it down. The JPEGS are good, and can be made excellent with Photoshop Elements. The 45-200mm lens is a nature photographer's dream and has excellent macro capabilities. I also use a Sigma 105mm macro lens on the adapter. This works well, too, but will only focus manually.<br /><br />All in all, a great camera."

Very good RAW quality files.  Can produce great and very sharp images<br />2. Excellent prime lenses (25mm and 34mm).<br />3. Good metering.<br />4. Excellent target tracking.  I.E. touch press to select a target and the camera does a good job tracking the target you selected.<br />5. Excellent ergonomics.  Everything is either at a single button away or at a pop-up menu away with minimal button presses.<br />Very customizable for quick control.<br />6. Very compact and light dimensions.<br />7. Very quick focus.  In fact, it is hard to go back to DSLR which is usually slower to focus.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />1. JPEG colours are BAD.  Must use different colour scheme than what comes from the camera.<br />2. No auto-ISO in M mode.  If you want to shoot in a specified Aperture and Shutter speed, you must also select ISO manually.  If you afterwards switch modes you are left with manual ISO.<br />3. Focus does not follow tracked target.  The target is well tracked, but the focus in video can take several seconds to follow.  I find myself frequently half-pressing the shutter to refocus.  Thus it's actually a semi-automatic focus only.<br />4. AF-C is pretty useless and will end up with misfocused shots.<br />5. Won't focus in low light.  If light is not sufficient the camera will simply refuse to try and focus and instead will flash a red square. However, this needs lower light level then just indoor evening lights.<br />6. Dynamic range is limited, and even at a good exposure the blacks are sometimes blocked.  More then I am used to with other cameras.  This is true even in base ISO.  Specially evident with girls in black hair and bright clothes.<br /><br />That's pretty much what I can come up."

It has enough adjustment to keep a pro happy, including touch screen, and a near flawless auto mode when you need it. My only issue is when you go to take a low light shot, it will only go to ISO 800 automatically, to go higher you must manually adjust it, which wastes time (I bought a Panasonic GX1 to get around this issue, it goes to ISO 1600 automatically). The flash is a bit weak if you are trying to fill a room, but perfect to fill flash a close up flower or child. Auto white balance is a bit cool, but can be adjusted to suit your taste. The screen is bright and sharp, easy to see in the daylight, and swivels and tilts. Images are clean, detailed and smudge free at normal ISO, and noise supression is adjustable. The autofocus is instant and always spot on.<br />But I sold it anyway, because if I am going to carry anything bigger than a Canon S95, I may as well carry a full size DSLR. The APS-C sensor in the DSLR has greater dynamic range and deeper color saturation (especially blacker blacks and whiter whites, noticable in white clouds especially). I can have any camera I want (and have owned dozens) and the one I usually use is an old Sony A300 (even nicer than the F3 or A55). I prefer the older CCD senors, rather than the new CMOS, to me the color is richer and the ability to render subtle tonal range is superior.<br />The final issue is depth of field, which is much more controllable on a full size DSLR, many of the images coming from the G3 (or any micro 4/3 camera) looks the same as from a small point and shoot.<br />If size matters, it is a great choice, if size does not matter, why bother?"

Great system but the lenses are not really supported any more by newer bodies as Olympus has gone to micro 4/3. I had heard good things about Panasonic and Olympus and the small size appealed to me. I have an active 2 year old and I wanted a high quality camera that also took video and was lightweight and easy to use; yet had a fast shutter and took great pictures.<br /><br />Enter micro 4/3. The web has a wealth of in-depth reviews of almost all cameras. People really are enthusiasts when it comes to photography. So I would check those out. Right now this camera is an absolute steal. I actually went for a body only and then the kit lens 14-42 sold here so I can comment on both. I bought the E-Volt when it was a couple of years old and you can really get great value if you are willing to take that approach.<br /><br />The G3 has exceeded my expectations. It takes crisp, vivid, detailed pictures with very accurate colors. The 'contrast' focusing is very fast. The G3 has a lot of great features. One of the best is the intelligent auto. You have 2 options. One that does almost everything and another one where you can select depth of field, white balance, and under or over exposure the picture. A great design element that I think EVERY camera manufacture should follow is that there is not a separate mode on the mode dial for getting into intelligent auto. Rather there is a button that changes any of the modes into intelligent auto. So if you like aperture priority you can stay on that and then just hit and un-hit the button to get into the auto mode whenever you like.<br /><br />Another great feature is the viewfinder. The screen is great. It swivels, it is high quality you can touch it to focus and even use it as a shutter. But the electronic viewfinder is great, especially with a telephoto lens. The trade of this though is that it is not as compact as some of the other 4/3. But it is still more compact and lighter than any DSLR.<br /><br />Great video. I have the kit lens and also the Vario PZ 45-175mm. That lens takes better video than any camcorder I have ever used. Extremely good outdoor video. Good indoor video.<br /><br />Kit lens: great optics, but cheap zoom. People vary widely on the kit lens. Since I bought the body first I had a lot of options for lens. I went with the kit lens because many reviews I went to said the kit lens had great optics but 'felt cheap'. The optics though people said were on par with the older 14-45 kit lens. The optics are very good with this kit lens. And the zoom is not an issue on pictures. However it does take some practice on videos or you will get a very choppy and noisy zoom.<br /><br />Micro 4/3 is now going to be my 'beyond good point and shoot' photo system. I like that lenses can be used on Panasonic and Olympus bodies and the reviews of the lenses. I mentioned&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Panasonic-Lumix-G-X-Vario-PZ-45-175mm-F4-0-5-6-Lens-for-Panasonic-Lumix-G-Series-Digital-Cameras/dp/B005J5TZWK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Panasonic Lumix G X Vario PZ 45-175mm/F4.0-5.6 Lens for Panasonic Lumix G-Series Digital Cameras</a>. In addition to that you might want to check out highly regarded 20mm lumix lens and a 25mm Panasonic Leica lens. They are pricey. Make no mistake you can easily spend DSLR money on a micro 4/3. But I was able to get the body, kit lens, and 45-175 all for under $600 in February of 2013.<br /><br />One other lens I should mention as a 'prime' lens (prime means fixed focal length) it is the sigma 30mm. Sigma also makes a 19mm. The current versions are highly rated. But in late January they announced updated lenses in what they are calling their 'art' series. They still don't have nearly the f stop the 20mm and 25mm I mentioned above do, but I may hold off getting a prime until those come out.<br /><br />Bottom line with the G3 is DSLR quality in a (relatively) small body. Great user friendliness, super responsive focusing, quick shutter action (compares to DSLR NOT high end point and shoot), and a variety of highly ranked lenses. But for all of that you are spending close to or as much as DSLR money. Was it a good choice for me? Yes. The lighter weight, smaller the cameras are the more use they will get. I just don't want to lug around a lot of camera when out with the family. And the pictures are great. The price now is less than many point and shoot. Your zoom range is less, but oh how much camera itself you get for the money."

I'm a convert to micro 4/3,I also have a canon T3 SLR and I can say that I can't tell the difference in 90 percent of the shots. This also performs fast in shot to shot. It's autofocus is remarkably fast. It's only hindrance is at night when the evf is slow and grainy.<br /><br />This is almost half the size of an SLR. If  you are tired of lugging that SLR and you are not into special lenses then this is the way to go. Keep in mind though that it will also cost you more.<br /><br />Overall a great camera that makes using it a pleasure.

I picked one up yesterday and have enjoyed playing with it. Nothing major to complain so far, just impressed.<br /><br />My reasons for choosing the G3: 1. SMALLER SIZE - a smaller, lighter travel camera than my Sony DSLRs, with better image quality than that of a point & shoot (and hopefully as good as the DSLR's).  2. cost/value  3.  must have a view finder, clip-on or built-in  4.  reviews indicate that Panasonic has made tremendous improvements on this latest interpretation of micro 4/3.<br /><br />The bonus features of the G3 I find are: built-in EVF, flash and hot shoe; more ideal swing-and-rotate LCD screen; lots of adjustments and touch screen; magnified manual focus.<br /><br />It will not replace the bigger APS-C size camera in terms of performance or image quality.  But it's good enough, as an additional camera in your arsenal. My travel strategy is to carry this G3 and a Sony HX5V (for its complementary capabilities of GPS, panorama, low light, pocket size and zoom range).<br /><br />So go grab a Panasonic G3 quick."

I did quite serious research in various DSLRs, 4/3rds, mirror-less APS-C cameras, and ended up choosing G3. It's not the best camera in the world, every camera has its own trade-offs, it's just the most satisfactory camera for my needs for the money I was willing to spend. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />First of all, I would recommend to anybody considering buying this (or any other) camera do three things:<br />-- Read professional reviews on dpreview dot com, it's important to see the objective tests and read professional opinion. But don't make final decision based on professional reviews. What reviewers achieved in controlled environment, putting their best efforts, may not be representative of what you get. In fact most cameras look in reviews much better than in reality.<br />-- Check the average Joe the photographer pictures on pbase, flickr, etc. See how punishing or forgiving the camera is, compare to other cameras. I find the pictures of water especially revealing. Does the water look dark,  muddy, blotchy with visible noise, or pleasantly smooth, even oily? I found many G3 water images very pleasing. It's possible for a camera to produce outstanding results in controlled environment and yet fare much poorer in casual use.<br />-- If possible, handle the camera in the store. See whether you like the weight and size, how soft/hard the release button is, whether you like the viewfinder, are dials/buttons readable, how quickly it focuses, etc. When I was trying to decide between Panasonic DMC-G3 and Sony NEX-5N, I found the first was a lot more comfortable in my hands, and I immediately noticed that Sony was hunting trying to focus in low light situation, while Panasonic locked focus quickly and silently. The small stuff like that may make a superb otherwise camera a source of annoyance, so try it before buying.<br /><br />I don't want to repeat technical reviews, which you can easily find on the web, rather mention pros and cons of this camera in my subjective opinion.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Perfect size and weight. This camera feels very comfortable in my hands and is easy to carry around. I have a Canon DSLR also and find it too heavy, too cumbersome to carry, especially with large lenses.<br />Most pictures require little or no post-processing in normal settings. Colors are pleasing, well saturated, contrast is perfect, default sharpening is just right. Jpeg images are acceptable for web use, raw images look much better in print, especially when shooting landscapes. Though I think the colors are close to reality, I wouldn't vouch for that and frankly I don't care. I'm not a forensic photographer, it's more important to me if the colors are pleasing to look at and bring up memories of the event. So when I hear from Canon DSLR users about their plasticky dull colors that they are very real, I can't care less if it's true or not. I know that bringing up pleasing vibrancy in Canon images isn't easy and often impossible. After using Canon DSLRs for almost ten years I feel a lot happier with Panasonic images.<br />* Autofocus is very quick and absolutely silent.<br />* Manual focusing with three mode magnifier works great. Since the picture you see in the viewfinder comes from the sensor, what you see is what you get. No front or back-focusing problems, with any lenses, which is a common problem even with expensive DSLRs. Additionally, auto+manual focusing mode is an absolute gem. I keep camera always in this mode. If you don't have an opportunity to manually focus, do nothing, camera will focus automatically; if you do want to focus manually, touch the focus ring and camera will assist you.<br />* I like the fact that flash is built in, and not a flimsy attachment, like in other cameras. It's quick to charge and always at hand, which is great because you never know when you might need it.<br />* An electronic viewfinder is also a very good idea, in most cases it's more convenient than LCD. It's not as good in low light as optical viewfinder, but it shows more useful information and has additional functionality that optical viewfinders don't have, like manual focus assist.<br />* Swiveling touchscreen LCD is also pretty handy. It makes it very easy to shoot from any position. I also like the fact that you can touch the screen to select the focus area and camera starts tracking it.<br />* Good sensor resolution and more importantly high spatial frequency contrast produces well defined images. Pixel peeping folks should be satisfied. Full-size images look spectacular on large screen monitors. Enlargements are pretty easy too, 11x14 can be viewed from any distance without pixelization or loss of sharpness. I also printed 20x30 and they look sharp from 2 feet or more.<br />* Video looks very good to me, though I haven't used it much.<br />* If you have a Panasonic large-screen TV, then pop the SD card straight from the camera in to TV SD slot and select Viera tools and you can watch videos or slide shows without any additional processing.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Buttons on the right side could have been designed better. I frequently inadvertently press some of them with the thumb.<br />* Buttons take time to get used to and remember how to set what you want. It's frustrating to scroll through pages of menus trying to locate stuff.<br />* Low light, low contrast focusing can be imprecise, but this is a common problem of contrast focusing cameras.<br />* High ISO pictures aren't particularly bad, but noise and blurriness become visible even on modestly large prints. It's not bad for web, but for large prints one should keep ISO under 200.<br />* Battery is weak, good for only 270 pictures.<br />* The choice of lenses is not big and they are quite expensive.<br />* No Photoshop included! Instead you get a Silkypix software. It misses many useful Photoshop features, though it does have the essentials, but it's also a useability disaster. The program is so backwardly designed, it looks like it was created in 1980's.<br /><br />Finally, a few recommendations from personal experience. Shooting in RAW reveals more small detail and more importantly preserves better tonal transitions in landscape photos, so they look a lot better, I would recommend using RAW for those pictures for any size prints. To produce sharp, detailed pictures for large prints, you should keep ISO low, shutter speed shorter than 1/2f - 1/4f, or better yet use a tripod. Test your abilities to hold the camera steady, take pictures hand-held and with tripod and compare them on pixel level to see how much your hands are shaking. Every lens has its sweet spots where it shows best sharpness and contrast. You can find MTF charts for many lenses on the web. Many lenses have the best performance around F8. It also makes sense to use manual focus when feasible. Again, compare manual focusing with autofocus in various light condition to see when to use what. Taking pictures with telephoto 200-300 mm lens can be challenging. When you close the aperture down to F8, and set shutter to at least 1/1000, and ISO to 160, you can shoot only in a very bright sunny day. Therefore, a tripod when using telephoto lenses is virtually always a necessity. Also if you have difficulty manually focusing because your hands are shaking, you aren't likely to get sharp pictures. Get some practice on a gun range, familiarize yourself with shooting breathing techniques, take a half breath, let some out, hold it, steady your hands, push the trigger slowly. Many people blame a camera or lens for their blurry pictures, while the real reason is shaking hands, or poor focusing, or high ISO."

When I got my camera I was disappointed  with the fact Panasonic had changed the battery from my GF1.. that said, the battery took overnight to charge and then shot only a few images without going dead. I read on the net that you could not use the rear panel LCD screen to view during shoots if you wanted to take more than a few images before the battery died.. Well after cycling my battery a few times, it charges fast and holds a good strong charge. This summer I shot a car show, taking more than 400 images using the EVF and then opened the LCD to compose with it and shot more than 400 more images using the rear panel to compose in full sunlight before the battery died. SO, my initial fear of poor battery life has been put too sleep. The thing I love about the camera is the simple fact, if you use a manual focus lens from your Leica lens collection or other brand of manual lens, the new LCD panel contains enough data to allow you to easily focus without the need for an accessory to aid in seeing if the lens is properly focused... I love the images I got with the GF1, the G3 is a much improved camera, you will love it.. With the small size and weight, you can lug this all day with a nice selection of lenses and not fear fatigue from carrying a large kit all day in the hot summer sun.... this camera really is a wonderful tool."

It is smaller and lighter than traditional DSLRs, yet remains well balanced and easy to use. The G3 feels very much like Panasonic's FZ series cameras. In fact I use the same bag to carry it often.<br /><br />While the Canon-Nikon DSLRs are still ahead when it comes to action and low light, this camera proves that the MFT is catching up. It is already easier than DSLRs to capture video. The MFT system is turning out to be an excellent middle (2x crop) format system between the p&s and big DSLRs. The Lumix 20mm prime is a gem. Now I don't have to carry my heavy Canon camera+lens or settle for an Elph to get some decent pictures of the family on a day trip.<br /><br />In comparison to the PEN E-PL2, IMO the jpegs in the Olympus are better with the the 20mm prime. Pictures seem more natural and the PEN's retro-styling is nice. Both the G3 and E-PL2 are fun to use. I would say Panasonic is better at the technical aspects (sensor fab and overall build), where Olympus understands photography better (as an art). I like that both companies have different merits, but follow the same format.<br /><br />After the disappointing release of the GF2 and GF3, Panasonic redeems itself with the G3 and takes the MFT system forward. Wish they would make a range-finder version.<br /><br />Update 12/29/11 - Still the best micro 4/3 camera. Better than GX1."

I like that I can take still shots and video at the same time and I like the zoom. Otherwise it's too heavy for me. I have arthritis in my wrist and it aggravates it. I was upset about how long of a delay it had after each picture but then I put it on 'A' and it works great now. The colors in the pictures are pretty good but the pictures don't look sharp to me. I've had to sharpen/edit each photo I've taken. I love how quiet the camera is but I'd rather have clearer pictures. I'm hoping the more I play with it the more I'll figure things out with it. Like why it has all these different windows pop up when I just want to view my pictures in a slideshow on my pc? And how do I attach a telephoto lens to it?<br />==============<br />I've found myself using this camera more than my Nikon camera lately and I've fallen in love with it. I still have a lot to learn about it but I must be doing something right. Friends see the photo's and tell me that they want my camera. I'm a new photographer and I'm learning a lot with this camera. I feel bad that I only gave it 3 stars ar first. It definitely deserves 5. I just had to give it a chance to prove itself. I've attached some photo's to show you what it can do.

I am surprised it was not mentioned on Amazon reviews or in the 3 or 4 extensive digital camera reviews that I read.<br /><br />UPDATE:  This is not a noise I can get used too, and when I just shot a video in a quiet room it was amplified on playback.  No one else is mentioning this noise issue so I'm assuming this is defective.  Returning camera today!"

Manual settings are available for almost anything I want to do, but I've had to refer to the digital manual a great many times.  This is no point and shoot camera, although it works great for that too.  I had much difficulty learning how to get macro photos without blurring, but eventfully got great photos. The macro-zoom is something I did not expect and I'm super-pleased with that.  I can adjust the lighting, color, focus and get almost any type of photo I want, though for general use I leave it at Auto-focus +.  I like to take photos of insects, flowers and birds, so the manual settings are of great importance to me.  I also wanted to do time exposures, and although I would prefer to be able to set long time exposures, the longest exposure in this camera did permit me to photograph the aurora borealis with the use of a tripod, and the touch-up function.  The 60x zoom is very useful to me and I've photographed quite a few birds already.  It is very difficult to hold the camera still at the 60x level, but using a tripod for a bird is impractical when they are moving around.  I have to take several hand-held shots to get a good one, but usually succeed.  I am very pleased with this camera and it is everything I hoped for."

The lens quality, in my opinon, did not, in anywise, compare with the Leica lenses used on Lumix's other  &#34;point & shooter&#34; cameras, as there was no seeming crispness or sharpness.  I've owned 5 other Lumix cameras, and, after buying the 270, I  was so unhappy that I returned the camera to the seller and have since switched to Nikon.  The &#34;return&#34; process through Amazon and the third party seller went very smooth and the purchase price was returned to my Amazon account instantly.  In summing up, there was no problem with Amazon or the 3rd party seller.  For me, it was the product itself.  I can't understand what the Lumix merchandising folks were thinking of by adding the 270 model camera to their otherwise fine line-up of &#34;point & shooters&#34;.

The interface is very intuitive, so you can learn and grow into it as you go along. I've had it for several months now and it is a pleasure. Really like the handle, so you can really get a grip on it while shooting. (A left handed alternative might be a good idea.) The lens zooms into subjects nicely as needed. Only downside is the manual lens cover. Grew spoiled by auto-retracting lens covers over the years. But all in all a great option for taking better pictures without being too much camera."

The color is nice. It has lots of modes, but I found that I couldn't really use aperture priority or shutter priority if the light was low, it would tell me to open the flash, so I had to use manual.  The automatic modes are nice, you even have in-camera HDR and panorama mode.  I played with the panorama mode a bit for the fun of it. The macro mode is really a closeup mode, not real macro.  But the main falling point is the ultra zoom. It really doesn't give you 1200mm.  You have to lower the megapixels per shot to get more zoom, resulting in a fuzzier and fuzzier picture.  No 16mp shots at 1200mm.  I think you might get it at .03 mp, the smallest number. I went down to 3mp, and got fuzzy pictures at 108x (120 x is the maximum range of the lens).  See my collage of bird pics at  https://www.flickr.com/photos/11815777@N07/21994187512/ .  Obviously this is a great little camera, but not if you want good bird shots."

A great starter camera or even for veteran photographers that are looking for lots of zoom without the cost and weight of DSLRs. For only $250 (at the time of this writing) you get 1200mm range, insanely wide 20mm photos, and a camera that takes above average photos even in fairly low light. It also has allot of nice manual modes to go along with a very smart auto mode. It focuses pretty fast and pictures look good until you get really far into the zoom. Then you either need a good tripod or better lighting to take a really good pic from range. Impressively I was able to follow some aircraft while keeping long range zoom most of the time. Although once you do lose focus, it's hard to find it again.<br /><br />The main reason I got this camera was not for the picture quality but for the Movie Mode. I like documenting fast moving high altitude aircraft like Contrails and Chemtrails (Yes I said it) and many other interesting things in the sky. Since there seem to be hardly any decent Camcorders with any kind of serious zoom range, I had to look into Photo Cameras. The movies that this camera does take are quite impressive in terms of audio and video for a camera mainly meant for Photography. But one of the reasons I chose this camera other than taking decent photos was for smooth 60 Frames Per Second Video. The claims that this camera can do 60FPS are completely false because after you really dig, you find out the Sensor is limited to 30FPS. So even though the video may be encoded at 60FPS, you only see 30 because the sensor is limited to that frame rate. This is not a big deal to probably 90% of people that buy this camera but some want a dual solution for good photos/video.<br /><br />I'm now returning to try out the Olympus SP-100 that seems to have similar features as the FZ70 with a little higher price tag. Along with high speed video modes and a better motion tracking system for birds or other fast moving long distance craft. It seems true lifelike 60FPS is very hard to find on superzooms. I will miss the 20mm wide photos that this great camera is capable of.<br /><br />Again I want to point out that I rated this camera 4 Stars and find it to be on the best values out there for a camera period. It just didn't completely fit my needs of what I expected in a very competitive Superzoom field. For others who don't care about the stuff I mentioned, this is a 5-Star camera in most every way when you consider the price tag.<br /><br />UPDATE: I tested out the Olympus SP-100 and the Lumix totally destroys it. The noise on the Olympus is terrible and almost unusable in low light. The picture quality is smartphone quality at best. The stablization is poor and does not look like 60FPS either like it claims. ARRGH. Guess I'll have to be satisfied with the Lumix as there is not much in the way of high framerate video for superzooms."

The only 'issue' is common to a lot of cameras these days. It's got so many 'smart' options sometimes it tries to take the picture 'it' thinks is better and I have to hunt around to find a more manual mode to get it to take the picture I want it to.<br /><br />It is a bit hard to take star-pictures because it keeps trying to either adjust my time to get more light or take pictures and average them.<br />But that's a limitation more of the slightly higher learning curve to really use this camera. The stability at full zoom is great, much better<br />than the Nikon, for example.<br /><br />The lens is awesome, If you wide angle, be careful. It will fish-eye if you angle 'up or down' too much. Also<br />the other thing that is a limitation of most cameras that offer a '3d' feature is the 3d is not very useful because it only works<br />at 'max wide angle view', meaning distant scenery, which really never has much depth. 3d up close with the differences in depth<br />is what I wanted, but it disables the 3d if you zoom in at all or if what you're looking at is fairly close. So the twin-lens cell phone<br />that does 3d actually takes better 3d pictures for close up stuff.<br /><br />Otherwise I love it. The ring mount is 55 mm so it's fairly easy to use existing lens adapters and filters or get a ring adapter for it.<br /><br />The camera battery life is great and with an inexpensive 32 gb card it takes a lot of pictures and a lot of video. The sound recording<br />is also very good."

I spent weeks pouring over specifications and reading comparisons and reviews. The specs on this camera are very impressive and the built in flash range is better than most into the telephoto range. In the final analysis, however, I cannot recommend the FZ70 (or any other camera for that matter) regardless of how many megapixels, great zoom range, built in flash range, or all the advanced features today's bridge cameras include when it fails to simply accomplish the primary function of a camera (i.e. taking crisp clear pictures). Even though I will probably find myself paying double or better what I paid for the FZ70, I'm returning it to Costco today and going back into research mode.<br /><br />Contrary to the 'I Hate It' comment associated with a 1 star rating I don't hate this camera - I would gladly keep it and consider it a bargain if only it took crisp clear pictures."

I find myself at concerts taking 15-20 pics of the same bands hoping that at least one will come out without blur. Which means weeding through the pics as you put them on the computer so that you can find the best one to say upload to facebook. It is hard to take non blurry shots with this camera at a concert, especially if zooming in. For those of us that cannot afford the front row seats, this camera is great at zooming in, however getting the pics not to blur is the main issue.<br />-Again as I primarily use the camera for concerts, I also love to shoot videos to put onto youtube. This is the BIGGEST GRIPE for this camera and I cannot seem to find any info online about this or others having this problem, so I hope it is not just my unit. When at a concert, after 1-2 seconds of video, the camera automatically dials down the sound/bass by what seems to be 50-75%. This makes it almost impossible to hear any recorded video without completely maxing out your computer or youtube line. The camera does a good job of avoiding that nasty &#34;bass buzz&#34; that you would get from most cameras (such as the Kodak I used for 5 years at over 60 concerts). The Kodak had a mic that was mounted to the front so perhaps the speakers at the concert also facing the mic is what caused that buzz from the bass. With the mic being mounted on the top of this Panasonic it basically NEVER gets the bass buzz sound, but it just has that extremely annoying sound reduction that i cannot figure out. Does any one else have this issue? I turned off the wind noise reduction setting and assume that must be the issue is if it considers bass from a concert to be wind noise maybe that was why it reduced the sound but I had that reduction turned off...<br />-Lastly my other big complaint is when I showed up in Hawaii for an important vacation and I turned the camera on for the first time since I had been to a Rush concert 3 weeks prior (and always keep the camera in its padded case from the elements) but the lens interior had what appears to be dust inside. Unfortunately not knowing what to do I just used the camera for the entire trip taking over 1000 pics in the week. Unfortunately many of these once in a lifetime trip pics have dust particles going across the lens. I do not know what caused this but I will have to figure out what to do to clean that out but have no idea how that got there when I have taken care of the camera and did not have any dust during the Rush concert a few weeks prior.<br /><br />All in all: The camera does not take very good low light concert pics, but then again thats basically an issue with almost every point and shoot camera. The Video mic during loud concerts for some reason reduces all incoming sound by 50-75% for some unknown reason which causes you to have to max the volume out on your computer to even hear the video when watching it later. Dust collection in the lens came out of nowhere and will need to be taken apart to clean or remove if possible."

My Canon also began taking poor shots, related, I am convinced, to the lens issue.  And so I began to conduct a new study into an easy to use camera that could take gorgeous pictures.  My search lead me to the Panasonic Lumix.<br />With this camera, I can let my kids take pics on the automatic mode, and get a decent photo.  Or, I can play around with aperture and exposure to get a more artistic shot.  Either way, the huge display assures me that I've gotten something worth a second look (or a delete, as the case may be).

The cable took a week to arrive and it still does not connect to my compouter.  I called customer service today and after tryimng for a half an hour it still does not work.  Since it is out of the one year warranty, I have to pay shipping and send it back with all the parts.  The repair costs $180 which is a joke since the new camera is only $230.  Fortunately my laptop has a card reader so I do not need to connect the camera to my computer.  Still, the camera is defective after very little use and the cost of repairs is crazy.

Unfortunately, this is the second Panasonic Lumix camera that we purchased that has failed on us.<br /><br />I forget the model number of the first one, but it took wonderful photos for about 3 years, then the lens would not open completely.  We liked the camera so much that we decided to spend $150 to have it repaired.  The 'repaired' camera worked for about a year, maybe less, then failed again.  Same problem - lens would not open completely.  Waste of $150.<br /><br />I searched for a replacement camera but I could not find anything at a reasonable price that measured up to the combination of Panasonic and Leica.  So I bought the DMC-ZS8.  It, too, WAS a great camera.  But, it only lasted 15 months.  Now it just displays 'System error (Focus)' on the screen.  It doesn't do anything.<br /><br />Panasonic customer service offered NO HELP because the 1 year warranty had expired.  They want $180 to repair it!! (It only cost $150 new!!)<br /><br />Let me just emphasize here that we do not abuse cameras or anything else that we own.  We handle them very carefully.<br /><br />I thought I would not be able to beat Panasonic electronics combined with a Leica lens. I guess I was wrong. 'Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me'.  I will never buy another Panasonic camera, and will be unlikely to buy anything else from Panasonic again.  If you are considering this camera, I would strongly urge you to look to another brand.  I'm heading straight for Canon or Nikon."

Takes very nice pictures as long as lighting as adequate. It doesn't do well with low light. Or maybe I just didn't have long enough to figure it out because within a month I took the camera on vacation to Florida...in a nice padded case.  I did have it out on the beach the first day for all of 5 minutes or so.  It wasn't windy.  I wasn't near the water.  It was in the case - came out to take a few pictures - and went back in because the rain was coming so we left as soon as we got there.  We went from there to Epcot where I took a number of pictures before sitting down that evening to watch a musical show.  I was zoomed in fairly close and had taken maybe a half dozen pictures when the lens suddenly went blurry as if the camera had lost focus.  Lens kept going in and out repeatedly trying to regain focus and then I was prompted to power off and restart the camera.  Once I did I got the dreaded focus error that several others have talked about.  Nothing helped - not powering off, not removing the battery, nothing.  Each time I power it back on the lens automatically retracts all the way into the camera then extends all the way out and the error appears again and the camera shuts off.  It was not jarred and nothing got in it.  I was very careful due to the comments I'd read already but hello, it's a compact camera with a powerful zoom, not something made for a portrait studio. It's made to take with you when you live life.  Mine lived a month and now I'm sending it in and hoping it will be covered under warranty."

Stability works well and picture quality is OK for such a compact camera.  Viewfinder works, but automatic mode often blanks out display, even when reviewing pictures.

Panasonic,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS50K 30X Travel Zoom with Eye Viewfinder (Black),20150420,B00RBG687A,5,18,21,"on April 20, 2015",ANONYMOUS,A Winning New Lumix,"Lumix ZS50 Digital Camera<br />Manufacturer: Panasonic<br />Amazon price: $397.99<br /><br />The Panasonic LUMIX ZS50 is a new, feature-rich, compact, super-zoom camera that you can carry in your pocket. It was introduced at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in January, 2015. If I were to describe my perfect camera, I would describe it just this way. I don’t want to lug around a heavy bag and lots of gear, but I still want a great camera. As a longtime Lumix user I started with the TZ9 and as technology improved, moved to the ZS20. The new ZS50 has some remarkable improvements and enhancements. The three new features that convinced me were: a 2.0-inch live viewfinder so you can look through the camera’s lens instead of squinting at the LCD screen when out in the bright sun, a 30X (30 times!) optical zoom, and a new, 12.2-megapixel high-sensitivity MOS sensor for enhanced low-light photography.<br /><br />The camera includes built-in Wi-Fi connectivity that allows wireless transfer of your images to your computer or for display on an appropriate TV. I discovered a stunning feature when I started learning the camera’s wireless capabilities—smartphone integration! Panasonic has developed an Apple iOS and an Android app. Pairing the camera with your phone or tablet can be initiated by Wi-Fi or with its built-in NFC sensor. With the app, you can see what the camera sees on your iPhone or iPad’s screen. In addition, you can control the camera’s zoom and exposure and fire the shutter from the app. For instance, imagine placing the camera on a tripod near a bird feeder and taking photos of the activity while you monitor them from a distance on your iPhone—hands-free, remote photography.<br /><br />At $400, the ZS50 is not a budget point-and-shoot, it is a precision-built, quality camera with a Leica 24-720mm Vario-Elmar lens. This lens allows ultra wide-angle shots as well as an astonishing 30X optical zoom. In Macro mode you can get as close as 3mm for your subject. When you are out in bright sunlight and have difficulty seeing the LCD screen, you can use the Live View Finder with its clear, bright 1,166-dot resolution. The camera can be set so that its sensor will only turn the viewfinder on when your hold it up to your eye. The camera incorporates a state-of-the-art O.I.S.+ (Hybrid Optical Image Stabilization Plus) 5-Axis system for capturing jitter and shake-free images.<br /><br />This is a feature-rich camera. Its 46-page manual contains basic information and the manual on the included CD, is a whopping 306 pages. The ZS50’s settings can be personalized in dozens of ways. You can easily feel overwhelmed as there are almost too many features and choices. However, if you are diligent, you’ll end up with a camera that is customized to your own photography requirements. There is a large knurled control ring around the lens barrel that can be rotated for zooming, setting aperture, shutter speed, focus, and other adjustments. Rotating this control ring is done with one hand and feels very natural compared to fiddling with tiny knobs and switches. The ZS50 includes a fast 240fps Auto Focus. There is almost no lag here so you won’t miss a good shot while the camera is calculating and adjusting focus.<br /><br />The camera has a variety of creative features that I don’t use but they are available if you want to try them. There is a Creative Retouch feature, 15 Instagram-like filters, an auto-leveling setting (probably intended for use when video recording). There is also a strange selfie Jump Shot function that will fire the shutter at the apogee of a jump if you have a connected smartphone in your pocket when you jump.<br /><br />My interests lie in still photography, but this camera also takes very smooth 1,920 x 1,080 full HD video utilizing its stabile Venus Engine. The recording is done in AVCHD Progressive format. Birds and other rapidly moving objects can be captured with clarity.<br /><br />An intriguing feature for me is time-lapse. You can set the frequency of exposures and the result is an MP4 video file. Shoot a sunset at 10-second intervals, or an approaching thunderstorm, or a construction site from dawn to dusk. With the high-sensitivity MOS sensor, you can even shoot the stars.<br /><br />This is a versatile, well-built camera. It has an astonishing array of features. I’ve had many years of Lumix experience and I’m seriously impressed with the new ZS50. In the iA (Intelligent Auto) mode, all you need to do it aim and shoot with excellent results. But if you are a semi-pro, you’ll have most of the big, DSLR features at your fingertips even though the camera is tidy and compact."

Panasonic,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS50K 30X Travel Zoom with Eye Viewfinder (Black),20150419,B00RBG687A,5,5,7,"on April 19, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Most impressive point-and-shoot that I carry with me,"This is my initial experience of the Lumix DMC-ZS50K digital camera. I have been using digicams since the Sony Mavica came out. I love photography, not in a professional level but as a hobby and they are a big part of our lives as a family. This is one impressive camera for a point-and-shoot. I either lug along my DSLR or just shoot with a smartphone. For convenience I will go with the smartphone. But if I know I would be going to a trip to a place where we would shoot a lot of memories, a dedicated cam is the only way to go. The Lumix is small enough to carry along with my DSLR bag. It is small and the shape and profile is conservative enough with no awkward protruding lens.  It is easy to slip in one of the pockets. Either as a backup or a camera to just grab and shoot, it performs quite well.<br /><br />There are so many features that it will take you weeks to familiarize with all of them. For a quick shot, you can go to full auto modes. For more creative shots you can select manual and even does manual zooming. The Leica lens has a monster 30X optical zoom. It has an awesome stabilizer but for 30X you may still need a tripod. Panorama and shooting videos all benefit from the same stabilizer that creates seamless stitches and panning.<br /><br />If you misses the viewfinder, the ZS50 has the best of both worlds. A large LCD screen which I use often for shooting high def videos or the viewfinder which I am accustomed for shooting stills.<br /><br />If you cannot wait to send a picture to a friend, a family or to social media,  the WiFi function becomes real handy.  Download the app to your phone and fire it up.  Soon you can send pictures or even videos into your phone.  The interface is simple and easy.  You can then send it anywhere you want."

I got it because I wanted a small camera with both a viewfinder and a super zoom that could go everywhere and this fills the bill very nicely.  Color and general picture quality is quite good for a small camera, although it could be sharper, for my taste, especially at full zoom.I generally shoot in P,S, or A so I can adjust the settings as needed.  Because I like to underexpose I often set the EV down by at least a third.  I don't shoot raw, but this still allows me to tweak both the brightness and the sharpness of my JPEGs in Photoshop.  However many people will find this unnecessary as the pictures in automatic are usually very pleasing.<br />Some suggestions that work for me:  1) Get a neck strap if you use the camera for hiking.  This keeps it convenient to use and avoids the issue of pocket lint (or whatever, unless there's a dust storm) from getting into the unsealed camera.  I got mine several years ago from Polaroid and it has the advantage of releases (I'm not sure what to call them, pinch clasps?) on both sides of the strap so it can easily be taken off from the camera body without undoing the whole thing.  2) This suggestion is stolen from another reviewer and again addresses the &#34;lint&#34; issue while being very practical:  when carrying the camera in a pocket or purse, take the neck strap off (if you use one) and put the camera in a sandwich bag.  I add to that protection by first putting it in the thin envelope it came packed in. Not elegant, but convenient.  3) On an entirely different subject: if you use the macro setting - it's very nice - and switch to the macro closeup focus, remember to take it off when you're done.  Otherwise you'll be limited to 3X zoom instead of 30X in most other settings.  It drove me nuts and took me forever to figure out what I was doing wrong when this happened to me.  4) Unless you know that point and shoot is all you want to do, download the manual for advanced usage (or some such nomenclature.)  It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than the alternative.<br />If you've read through all this, you can tell I really like the camera for what it is.  While it will never replace my Olympus E-M1, it will go places I could never easily take my Oly - and already has."
Panasonic,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS50K 30X Travel Zoom with Eye Viewfinder (Black),20150418,B00RBG687A,5,28,30,"on April 18, 2015",ANONYMOUS,"About Viewfinder, LCD Screen, Burst & RAW","ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER:  The ZS50 has a very good  1166k dot viewfinder through which you can see clear details.  For those who wonder how this compares with the ZS40, the resolution is 5 times higher.  1166k versus the former 200,000k.  The viewfinder of the ZS50 is very usable while the viewfinder of the ZS40 was mainly for marketing.<br /><br />Most of the cameras that I have had over the years had a viewfinder and I much prefer to use it because framing photos is much easier for me than when holding the camera away from my body.  I'm using it almost exclusively with this camera and very pleased.<br /><br />Also for anyone thinking of upgrading from the ZS40, another improvement is the larger grip.  This makes the camera easier to hold when using the viewfinder.<br /><br />When I first looked through the viewfinder what I saw was not clear and sharp.  However, I gave the wheel for the diopter that is right next to the viewfinder tiny turns until what I saw was clear and sharp. The difference was huge.<br /><br />A neat new feature is the eye-detection sensor that automatically switches to the viewfinder as it nears your eye. No need to push a button to switch as was necessary with the ZS40.  The button is still there, but not needed.<br /><br />What you see on the LCD screen will also be seen when you look through the viewfinder.  For example, if you are using the 'level gauge' to be sure the camera is straight, you will see the level indicator when looking through the viewfinder same as if you look at the screen<br /><br />Even if you prefer to use the LCD  screen, practice with the viewfinder because it is very helpful when following the movement of distant objects and to give more support when you are zoomed out.  When the camera is held in both hands and pressed against your forehead it is more stable than when held away from the body.<br /><br />Also, the viewfinder is very handy when the LCD screen is hard to read because of the sun.<br /><br />Having a useable viewfinder gives this camera a big advantage over its rivals.<br /><br />LCD SCREEN:  The resolution of the screen has been increased to 1,040k dots, a small improvement over the 920,000 dots of the ZS40.<br /><br />The screen is pretty good in varying light conditions, but if you have trouble in the direct sun, or to lessen the chance of future trouble in the sun, there are some things you can do:<br /><br />1. Press the 'Menu' button, then select 'Setup'.  Click on it and scroll down to 'Monitor Display' .  Press the arrow that opens the choices and  move the 'brightness' indicator (yellow) all the way to the right.  I suggest you do that anyway and just leave it there.<br /><br />2.  If more needs to be done, scroll down one more line to 'Monitor Luminance'.  Open to the options and put it on ' Auto Power Monitor' {A*.  Leave it  there until times you need more help than go back and change the setting to  'Power Monitor'  [*.  If even that isn't enough, use the viewfinder.<br /><br />BURST MODE:  When there is any kind of action, this is much better than taking single shots.  You don't have to anticipate the exact moment something is going happen, you take a bunch of  rapid-fire photos and pick out the best ones.  Action is not just sports it can be children playing, a child learning to ride a bike, puppies playing, etc.<br /><br />A burst mode of 10 fps (frames per  second) is a big marketing point for this camera.  But it is misleading.  You can only shoot 10 fps when the camera is in the IA mode (Intelligent Auto) and you can only get six shots before the camera must reload, so to speak.  For this reason, unless you know the exact second when something significant will occur, you are not likely to make much use of this setting.  In this setting, focus is fixed with the first shot<br /><br />Also when in the IA mode you have the option of 6 fps.  When in this setting the camera keeps focusing and shooting as long as you keep pressing the shutter button.  I have gotten about 30 shots in this setting and could have gotten more.  But I didn't get 6 fps, it was closer to 4 fps.  However, the fps would have been closer to 6 if I had shot fewer photos.  It starts at 6 then tapers off as the camera processes the previous shots.<br /><br />In all modes, including P, A & S, you can shoot 3 fps and will get about 3 fps.  Again, the camera will keep shooting as long as the shutter is pressed and refocuses between shots.  I have shot as many as 40 when in 'P' mode of a car moving away from me and the focus stayed pretty good and the fps was about 3 for the entire 40. I good have kept shooting at the same fps, but the car turned a far corner,<br /><br />I am quite pleased with the burst mode.  There are cameras that will do better than this one, but in this price range it does a very satisfactory job.  I am especially pleased with how well it keeps focused when when shooting at 3 frames per second.  To test this, I sat at a street corner where I could look down the street.  When a car or motorcycle started down the street, I focused on the car/motorcyclist and started shooting until it turned a corner or it didn't make sense to continue.  I could then look at the photos on my computer and check the focus.  I was quite pleased that  even after 20 shots the object I had focused on was still in focus.  Reinforcing that were a couple of shots where a woman started crossing the street in the distance between me and the car.  She was not in focus in the photos, but the car was.  I did another test focusing on a distant car approaching me.  The photos were sharp all the way.<br /><br />You can also shoot in bursts when shooting RAW using the 3 fps setting, but I only get about 1.5 fps when I did again partly because of the number of images shot during the burst and partly because the RAW files are bigger than the JPEG files.<br /><br />RAW:  Many travel zooms do not offer RAW as an option.  My Canon SX700 doesn't for example.<br /><br />The debate about whether to shoot RAW or JPEG has been going on for a long time.  There are reasons for both, including that RAW files contain more details but require processing by software to make them fully useable, while photos shot in JPEP are useable as they come from the camera, having gotten some processing in the camera. (Though they can often be made even better by post-processing).<br /><br />However, what is important to know is that even though this camera is new,  software support for RAW files from the camera are already widely available, including, after installing the update which you will get from the software, Photohop Elements, Corel PaintShop, Photoshop and Lightroom. There is no need to download the RAW converter on the CD that comes with the camera if you are using one of these photo editing programs.  They are all better than the software on the CD.<br /><br />Because the camera's sensor is so small you can't retrieve as much shadow or highlight detail as on a camera with a larger sensor, but you can adjust white balance, sharpening and noise.  The RAW files also contain more color information than do JPEGs<br /><br />."

I have several & this is the only one where I felt immediate disappointment when I opened the box.  I received the camera Saturday.  I can't seem to get past the build quality & the fact that the flash is in a really bad place.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.  Build Quality.  The camera is all plastic & looks almost like a toy.  I bought the Silver.  I suggest the Black.  Maybe it will look better.  If I were to keep it I would purchase a Square Trade Warranty as I have doubts about its durability.<br />2.  Flash.  The flash is in a very awkward place right where you grip the camera.  You will have to be very mindful every time the flash is used & check finger positions.  I have very small hands & it is awkward for me.  If you have big hands it may be a problem.<br />3.  Battery Charger.  There isn’t one?  There is a charging cable that you can wall charge or PC  charge while  the battery is inside the camera.  My other Panasonics came with a charger & a cable.  I think Panasonic went econo with this feature too. (I realize you can buy a charger & additional batteries).<br /><br />PROS:<br />1.  Lightweight.  It is small & lightweight.  It will easily fit in a purse or pocket.<br />2.  Zoom is great.  However, get the closest shot that you can.  If you crop the photo it is going to be grainy.<br />3.  Photo quality.  It's OK.  In my opinion It’s a little better than cell phone quality.  The sensor is a 1/2.3 & most cell phones are a 1/3.2.  However, you don’t get a 30X Zoom with a cell phone (which is what attracted me to this camera.)<br />4.  Viewfinder.  I like the viewfinder & the fact that it’s automatic when you put your eye to it.<br />5.  Settings.  There are lots of settings much like other Panasonic Cameras.<br />6.  WiFi.  I didn’t try to use as I plan on returning the camera.<br /><br />I usually shoot in Auto, Program, or Scene modes (easy modes).  I want an easy to use, lightweight camera, with a decent zoom to put in my purse.  I thought this was the one.  However, the build quality & flash placement is such a turnoff for me that I’m planning on returning this camera.  I will stick with my trusty ZS7 that I’ve had since it was brand new.  It only has a 12X Zoom, no viewfinder, no WiFi but its built a whole lot better & my finger doesn’t block the flash."

Professionally I use my Canon 7D Mark II, but I wanted something pocket sized. First, I wanted an eye level viewfinder. Most point & shoots don't have one. The Lumix gives you the option of switching between eye level or the LCD. Next the image quality is very good for 12 megapixels. Using a medium file size, I can enlarge posters to more than 100% with any noticeable degradation in the image.<br />The menu is extremely user friendly, and gives you the usual choices of A, S, M etc. I use manual mostly on my Canon because I want total control. The Lumix adjusts ISO automatically, as I like to use it with shutter preferred at 1/125. With its built in stabilization, I am guaranteed to get sharp images. For the Lumix I would never use flash. Natural light is always best. The price is good. The build is solid. And it focuses quickly too.<br />And last,  but not least, a Leica lens!"

I buy toys.  The good news I use them.  So far, under easy conditions, I've shot about 200 pics with this latest of my Lumix cameras.  I THINK, and know it could be fooled by the name, that the Leica lens matters.  I suspect that problems some might have with this camera may be underestimating it.  Just because you have 700 MM in your hands, even with stabilization, does not mean you no longer need a tripod or solid support at 700 mm.  I love this camera.  Because of my shopping illness, I have a number of options.  I've learned that a view finder and not just a rear-screen is essential.  Mandatory.  I have a crossover Leica.  It takes better pictures, and cost double.  Well now, triple almost.  It is larger.  I love it.  I keep grabbing this Lumix to be within arms-reach when I'm on &#34;bird alert.&#34;  I also have rather large hands, and even with this camera being pretty small, I find it comfortable.<br />It has a very handy feature I've had before and love.  When you put your eye to the viewfinder, the screen display automagically switches to the viewfinder.  I really get annoyed by having to push a button to go from screen-view to viewfinder view.  I'm easily annoyed I know.<br /><br />Problems?  of course.  The knob that rotates (some have said the ink wears off, but I don't know yet) for selecting options on menus and the like rotates too easily.  I end up changing things I did not intend to change.<br />Basically, once again, Lumix w/ Leica glass has put out a camera that delivers GREAT bang for the buck.  Does my BIG Sony with a dedicated 100 mm macro lens, 24 megapixels, full frame chip get a better image?  Sure.  Does it fit in my pocket?  Not as well.  Can I take a real  full moon picture with it? Happily, for the first time in my life yes.  BUT I love this Lumix.  It is a bit larger than the pocket-sized Lumix before it, but that one did not have a viewfinder.  The 500 or so mm was fine.  The image was fine.  The size was astonishing for what it delivered.  BUT, shoot in daylight?  A viewfinder is a good thing.<br />This camera deserves respect.  If the care that one might put into shooting with a large camera with a 700 mm lens is put into this low-key gem, the results will, I think , astonish."

I probably need more expertise and time with the camera to perfect those shots since the automatic feature doesn't do well in those situations.

Turns out there aren't many choices that fit all these criteria.  I enjoy photography, am a highly experienced photographer although not a pro, and have a really good camera with interchangeable lenses, etc. which I use when I want to get top quality pics and need to have a lot of control over focus, depth of field, mounted flash, etc.  However, when traveling by air, hauling all that equipment around, taking up space in carry-on luggage, etc. tends to make me leave the really good camera at home.  With pocket cameras I've used, I really miss having a viewfinder.  I find them awkward to hold steady, and difficult to see on the backside LCD panel exactly what I'm getting in bright light  or when I need to follow and catch fast moving objects (e.g., flying birds), particularly when the zoom is extended. I've been frustrated when I can't get the pics I want with those pocket cameras.<br /><br />So I went out on a limb, spent a little more than I had intended, and got the new Panasonic Lumix ZS50, which I preordered.  I seldom buy new models of anything when they first come out, so for me this was a bit of a gamble.  However, I have been pleasantly surprised so far with this little camera.  It has an amazing feature set for something that really does fit in my pocket, has a good viewfinder and plenty of zoom.  I have not given it a true test yet, taking thousands of pics under a wide range of lighting and distance conditions, so I will have to report back later.<br /><br />What I like so far:<br />- camera takes good pictures in the auto mode under most conditions<br />- viewfinder works well in bright light conditions, and switches on automatically when you hold it up to your eye<br />- zoom and focusing are relatively quick and quiet<br />- the steady shot feature works well, especially in shooting video<br />- flexibility and control in non-auto modes (e.g., program mode when I want more control over depth of field, etc.)<br />- several different focusing and exposure methods<br />- ability to save images in RAW format as well as JPEG<br />- the right hand grip feels fairly secure for such a small camera<br /><br />What I don't like so far:<br />- viewfinder is off-center when holding the camera, compared with what I'm used to with larger cameras, so I can't grip it as securely with my left hand (because my nose is in the way) BUT I love having that viewfinder anyway!<br />- lots of MODES in the menu system for settings (I eventually found that I needed to switch to program mode in order to find settings I was looking for, e.g., to save pics in RAW format, change focusing methods).  Can be confusing at times, a bit of a learning curve.<br />- the LCD display sometimes suddenly turns off and then back on, which had me baffled initially when playing back pics.  Turns out I had moved a finger too close the the viewfinder, which fooled the camera into auto-switching to the viewfinder.<br />- when taking flash pictures, it's too easy to partially block the flash somewhat on the right side, which casts a shadow--just something I'll need to get used to by gripping a little differently on the right side (I've had this problem with other pocket cameras that don't have pop-up flashes).  Works fine when I move my fingers down on the right-side grip a little.<br />- when doing the wi-fi setup, I could not enter user names or passwords that had spaces in them--I am stumped on this, and cannot understand why Panasonic would not allow selection of the 'space' character!!!<br />- wi-fi will not transfer pics in RAW format, so have to use cable or take out memory card and plug into my computer--again, why?  Granted 15 Mb per pic will take a lot longer to transfer than smaller JPEGs.<br />- cannot charge battery outside of camera and must use Panasonic's cable<br />- not sure yet whether 12 megapixel sensor will be enough resolution for severely cropped pics, printed at 8x10 in. or larger<br /><br />All in all, this is hands-down the best pocket camera I've owned and used.  Why not 5 stars?  I'll need to really give it the &#34;road&#34; test by taking thousands of pics under a wide range of conditions.  Haven't had time to do this yet, and plan to edit this review later when I have.<br /><br />Added Comments:  April 26, 2015<br /><br />I've changed my rating to 5 stars now, after taking several hundred pictures under varying conditions.  Here are my further observations:<br /><br />- Indoor pictures with flash turn out fairly well.  There are still sharp background shadows from objects illuminated by the flash, but that is to be expected with a direct flash (compared to one with indirect lighting, e.g., by bouncing light off the ceiling).<br />- outdoor pictures are quite good on the whole.  The 30x zoom certainly provides some additional flexibility, and I have not had issues with camera shake when the zoom is extended.<br />- the one very challenging condition I was somewhat disappointed with was photographing fast flying pelicans at a distance on a very windy, overcast day.  Many of the photos of the birds were taken at distances of several hundred yards up to half a mile, using the zoom extended out to 30x.  I WAS able to track the birds relatively easily using the viewfinder. When later viewing the images with significant cropping on a flat screen HDTV, clarity of the images left something to be desired--a bit fuzzy on the edges of the birds against the cloudy sky. This is a very challenging set of circumstances--even with a good DSLR camera with a long telephoto lens, it would be challenging to get high quality pics.  All in all, the Panasonic ZS50 did a remarkable job, considering the distance involved, with background of a cloudy sky, the speed of the flying flock of birds, and the fast panning required. The severely cropped images of the high flying birds still allowed my wife to identify them as white pelicans by comparing with pictures in her bird book.<br />- I took some pics of blossoms and flowers with the camera just a few inches away, using the close-up focus setting on a sunny and very windy day.  These came out exceptionally well.  I was very pleased with the results.  The pictures were quite stunning on a flat screen TV.<br /><br />All in all, I am quite impressed with this pocket camera, and enjoy taking pictures with it, since it is so light, has a decent viewfinder, and takes good photos.  I use the Program mode mostly, rather than the Auto mode.  Of course, I can get great pics with my really good camera, but I've invested roughly 4x as much for the body, lenses and external flash unit.  On the other hand, this Panasonic ZS50 fits in my pocket, is easy to use, and costs a lot less."

I hope to be able to learn how to take advantage of the manual options, now that we are back home.  I haven't notice any quality issues that a few other reviews have complained about.

The only real negative review I read was that the paint on the round toggle switch to change modes and shooting preferences, wore off.  I figured this was an isolated incident as there was only one complaint of this.  I purchased the camera and I decided to take this camera for a spin on my trip to Central America.  After the second day of shooting, the paint on the toggle switch began to wear off.  By the 4th day of shooting, the paint was completely gone, leaving just a blank round toggle switch!  Perhaps this was from perspiration or sunscreen or just the friction from my finger on the switch.  I contacted the company I purchased it from (through Amazon) and was informed it was past the 30 day warranty so I called Panasonic and they told me to send it into their repair center in texas and the part would be replaced.  The paint is not supposed to come off that easily and he felt maybe there was a &#34;printing issue?!&#34;  I of course have to pay for the shipping but the 1 year warranty covers the repairs.  In addition, I had several occasions where the plastic 2 door shutter would not close all the way to protect the lense.  After shooting, I would close the camera and the shutter would stay partially open, exposing the sense to potential damage.  This problem resolved on it's own after turning the camera on and off multiple times but I assume it's going to be an intermittent issue.  For such a promising technological camera, it's made very poorly.  If you do decide to purchase this camera, I would HIGHLY suggest fashioning some sort of clear coat plastic cover over the round toggle switch to protect the letters from wearing off so easily."

Not a perfect camera but a great one.  In reality, it's probably a 4 to 4.5 star camera but because it has a view finder as well as a lcd screen on back, for me, that's worth an extra star.  I've never been good at walking around like a zombie, arms out straight staring blankly.  I have however learned to use view finders with one eye, while using the other to keep me aware of my surroundings.  I don't like being annoyed by glowing screens at darkened venues like concerts and other night time events. It's rude folks...stop it! I have an FZ18 as well as an FZ70 for more  serious stuff.  But I like the convenience of a small point and shoot with a view finder eyepiece. I also have a collection of older high end 35mm SLRs<br /><br />The basics:<br />I purchased the all black ZS50 which is the 'K' model I believe.  Mine was set for Caracas time zone and came with Spanish Language owners manual.  But that's okay as I am bi-lingual.<br />Camera fits in a man's dress shirt pocket. It is fairly solid (heavy) but not so much as to be objectionable. Flash is built into front top of camera and does not pop up  All knobs and buttons are well placed. Holding and using the camera feels normal and natural. ( I have perfect vision, no glasses or contacts to get in the way) Electronic viewfinder is bright, color accurate and proportionally accurate to area captured by lens.  Leica glass optics.  Zoom is fast and easy to use. 30x optical and mine goes out to 57x electronically. For some reason, I though it had a 60x digital zoom but mine only ('only' LOL) goes out to 57x.  Having started in the 1950s shooting two and a quarter inch large format negative film, I have to chuckle and at the same time be amazed by what these little gems can do.<br />I'll let you read all the tech details online, but it has them all, aperture priority, manual focus, video, sepia, and a million special effects. It has a 12 mega-pixel MOS sensor which is way better (technical term) in low light than other previous sensors. I would compare it to a 16 or 18 megapixel sensor which in my opinion is just overkill. I don't know why, but I can take many low light shots without a flash and get realistic definition and color.  Autofocus could be a bit faster, but I really can't complain since I use the heck out of my cameras and expect them to  survive under the abuse I put them through all over the globe. For most folks, you won't even notice the extra millisecond or so . I'm using a class 10 64GB SD card in mine and it seems to work fine. My older ZS3 P&S can't hold a candle (sorry) to this ZS50.<br />The camera does not come with an external battery charger.  You have to plug the camera into line voltage to recharge - this always makes me a bit nervous.given the sensitive electronics in the camera and the sad state of the US power grid. I bought an external charger with two batteries and a car charger from Wasabi which is also sold on Amazon.  I have no affiliation with Wasabi and no profit motive.  I'm sure other chargers are just as good.  Finally, the ZS50 has WiFi as well as cables.<br /><br />If you need a medium price, pocket size P&S with tons of capability and a battery saving VIEW FINDER EYEPIECE, this is a great choice."

I was one of those people until I spent a ton of time going through the manual and playing with the camera to see what different settings do.  An example of something that I learned that made a huge difference when using the semi auto (Shutter Speed or Aperture) settings, is what to do with your flash settings when taking outdoor pictures.  If you are manually setting your shutter speed, and  flash is set to Auto, it will never tell you that that speed won't work.  You could set it on 1/2000 and it will stay white (setting OK) because it believes the flash will fix it. The flash can't light up the whole outdoors!!  Turn you flash off,  and it will go Red if you set the shutter speed to fast.  This is just one example of inappropriate settings causing bad pictures.  The zoom on this camera is incredible.  I posted two pictures taken from the same spot.  One no zoom, the other fully zoomed (optical + digital 120x total) in on a toy that is in the middle of the first picture.  Pictures were taken with no tripod. It is beyond what I thought zoom could do on a compact camera!"

I'm not much of a photographer yet and this let me take better quality photos at the point and shoot level and got me excited about learning more and more about my camera without shelling out for a dslr and with having the ease of a smaller camera that can fit into any purse and most jacket pockets.<br />I bought the camera June 23, 2015 and I currently (Oct 10,2015) have a lovely little brick that does nothing. After repeatedly poorer and poorer sensitivity, the power button quit working on me. I could turn the camera on by taking out the battery and the putting it back in (yes, the battery is fully charged), but the power button will not turn on the camera. I sent it in to Panasonic support and found out today that the camera was water-damaged. WHAT!? There were a few extremely humid times that we used it and once in a very light drizzle, but water damage is not something that ever ever ever remotely crossed my mind. So my only options after 3 months of using a $350 camera is to pay $280 for a replacement. Nothing they can do to fix it. Nothing. It's apparently a brick now. Super disappointed in apparently the fragility of this camera and Panasonic support. I would never recommend them.<br />As mentioned in other reviews, the ink on my mode dial also completely wiped off after the few months of use. Not a huge problem because you can use the screen to see which setting you are on, but still... a small indicator of the lack of thought that was put into this camera."

The display is absolutely stunning and so much easier to see outdoors than my Sony RX1002 or my Canon G11.  The 30x optical zoom and the image stabilization is amazing.  I also love that it shoots in RAW format, the wifi feature set up very easily with my iPhone, it's controls are easy to understand and navigate, and it has an &#34;on board&#34; HDR, which is also very useful for my art.  Overall, I am very satisfied and I think the price was quite reasonable.  I do have a few disappointments:  the exposure range for bracketing and for the HDR seems too narrow and I can't find anyway to adjust it (my Sony RX1002 does a much better job with these features).  The camera is very light weight (which is good) but compared to my Sony and my Canon it feels &#34;cheap&#34; and more likely to break.  I've already had one incident where the lens cover wouldn't open upon deployment and I had to gently pry it open with my finger.  Also, this Panasonic just doesn't seem to be as &#34;robust&#34; as my Sony RX1002--not as many features, settings, adjustments, etc.  --almost feels a bit &#34;toy like&#34;.  Overall, I do not have &#34;buyer's remorse&#34; and will certainly be using it.  But I'm not sure it will replace my other cameras, which means I will probably be walking around with two pocketables!  If only my Sony had a 30x optical zoom!!!"

I own MANY cameras, from Hasselblads to an 8X10 view camera. I have numerous 35mm SLRs, and a couple of very nice DSLRs. I have taught photography at both a high school and at a community college. What I'm saying is that I do have a background on which to base my review!<br /><br />I bought this camera for travel, hoping I could leave my bulkier cameras home. Well, home they are staying! This camera will work perfectly for my vacation needs, with the incredible extra advantage of being pocketable!<br /><br />Okay, this isn't something a pro would use for an important shoot. But it comes close to matching my Canon T1i in image quality, and has FAR better video capability. I normally carry the Canon wherever I go, but now I just stick the ZS50 in my pocket.<br /><br />The long zoom, the viewfinder, and the ability to shoot in RAW are what drew me to this camera. It's a very nice little package, and I expect to take several thousand pictures on my vacation. If I have any further comments, I'll add this to this review.<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice, compact, high-quality point-and-shoot, buy this!<br />ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: If you do buy this camera, be VERY careful when you insert the semi-proprietary USB cable into it to charge the camera battery or transfer pictures to your computer (I bought an external charger and extra batteries, but still use the cable on occasion). It would be very easy to damage the plug in the camera if the cable isn't inserted in exactly the right orientation. This is the only shortcoming I've noticed thus far, but it isn't enough to tarnish any of the five stars!"

I have always been happy with them before.  I thought  that I was replacing my ZS-20 with an updated model with more zoom.  Instead I got a camera made in China with a battery and no battery charger.  The battery instructions were to charge it inside the camera.  I could not find a battery charger so I contacted Panasonic.  Only a replacement battery - no charger.  I did an on-line chat.  The rep did give me links to a battery charger that needed a cable, sold separately, and the battery.  In camera charging does not work for me because I often use three or four batteries a day during trips.  I had to spend another close to $200 just for 2 batteries, a charger and a cable just to be able to use this camera effectively.  I don't even know if this will solve the problem.  The extra zoom is hard to focus.  I don't know if it is just getting used to a new camera.  I think not.  I also called and spoke to a rep who kept saying she was sorry for the inconvenience.  I did not have this problem with previous Panasonic cameras."

No comparison to the photo's on an iphone 6, especially in low light or when you want to use the zoom; which is optically engineered (unlike smartphones that simply enlarge the captured image).. no contest here hands down better than any smartphone.<br />1.

Wifi and smartphone app  --if you like your images transferred to your smartphone or control your camera completely through the  smartphone, you can do so with an app.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />The panorama mode creates images that  are fuzzy.  They are also timed.  I think it actually creates a video and saves it as an image; and it will time out if you don't move it fast enough. You are better off creating your panoramas manually by taking 3-5 separate photos and stitching them together using photo editing software.  This isn't  convenient though. I"

While most of the pics and video looked great with its big sensor, there is more to a camera than the quality of the pics/video....there is its functionality and build quality.  These issues were great enough for me that I am returning the camera in the morning and waiting for the next version that I'm sure will fix many of these issues.<br /><br />Body Issues.<br />I have the Lumix ZS7 that I really appreciate now that I have used the ZS50.  why?  Because of the following:<br /><br />- The ZS50 has its flash right above where you grip the camera so your fingers more often then not will be blocking the flash.  Its fine if you always use two hands to grip this small camera so you can drop your right hand out of the way of the flash, but there are many situations where I hold it with one hand and those are the ones where your fingers will keep blocking the flash (see first 3 photos).  And whenever I handed the camera to a stranger to take our picture, they always blocked the flash, even when I warned them about it. The ZS7 has the flash skewed toward the center of the body, away from where you are gripping the camera, where this is never an issue.<br /><br />- Bigger screen?  Its not all used for some strange reason.  Actually has a bigger screen but small image than the PS7 (see last photo)<br /><br />- The control knob that rotates between all the shooting functions is printed with a dull ink against a flat background providing very low contrast which makes it very difficult to read in low light situations.  The ZS7 had black lettering against a shiny silver background making it easy to read in low light. (see 4th photo...looks ok here in bright light but cant read in dim light)<br /><br />- When the camera is first turned on, the lens extends out 3 times as far from the body as the ZS7 (see 4th & 5th photos for min and max extensions).  And this is in the wide angle position!! (ie it extends out even farther when zooming in on a subject).  This 4th image is as far in as it will contract when turned on for pics or video<br /><br />-The body has a textured plastic surface which I personally dont like as it feels cheap compared to the solid, smooth gloss surface of the PS7.<br /><br />Functionality:<br />- One of the most annoying things was its inability to focus on subjects when shooting video in what equated to bright dusk lighting (ie 1/2 hour after sunset).  I would repeatedly try to zoom in on a subject maybe 50 away but the camera kept searching for its focus point.  It focused if I zoomed all the way out but when I zoomed in, it lost its focus again.  Isnt this supposed to be great in low light?!?  This happened about 5-6 times on various days/situations.  Never had this issue with the ZS7.  There is no excuse for this.<br /><br />- Another deal killer for me is that when shooting video, its nearly impossible to zoom in or out at a slow rate, no matter how light one feathered the control.  It flies in out out with the slightest touch.  When shooting video, in most situations you want to pan slowly, which is controlled by your body, but also to zoom in and out slowly, which was impossible.  When played back on a big screen, the excessively fast zooming is very annoying.<br /><br />Summary deal killers for me were<br />- fingers constantly in front of the flash.<br />- difficulty in reading control knob in low light<br />- problem focusing<br />- inability to zoom and out slowly<br /><br />Annoying:<br />- Smaller image on screen<br />- Cheap feel of the body<br />- Excessive extension of lens from body<br /><br />While these may not bother a novice photographer, I'm  looking for a pocket size camera with better design and functionality to back up my professional SLRs...like my PS7 with a bigger sensor!"
Panasonic,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS50K 30X Travel Zoom with Eye Viewfinder (Black),20150409,B00RBG687A,5,16,18,"on April 9, 2015",ANONYMOUS,Awesome Travel Camera AND shoots RAW,"This camera shoots RAW images in addition to JPEG.  I just want to get that out there right away because there seems to be some confusion. For those that are not ware, RAW file types provide a larger array of post processing options without degrading the image.  If you only shoot JPEG, no need to even worry yourself with RAW images unless you want to go to the next level of photography.<br /><br />Image production with the JPEG file is very good with highlights, shadows, noise, dynamic range, expsoure, etc..  Focusing is very easy and the image stabilization feature works to reduce normal handshake, even for older folks.  Most folks will not go beyond shooting jpeg with this camera, which is fine.<br /><br />As former heavy semi-pro Nikon shooter (multiple bodies, all lenses and every accessory) and now a Fuji convert (X100s, xT1), I am very impressed with the ZS50k.  This camera more closely (of course) aligns with the Fuji X series camera bodies and functionaly/ergonomically close to the X20/X30 series cameras.  This comparison bodes very well for the camera, which comes in at a lower price point (about $120 lower).<br /><br />The build quality of the camera is fantastic.  The design and size of the camera makes it ideal for travel or everyday carry.  This is the type of camera (just like with the Fuji), you will always have on you because it is easy to carry all the time.  Camera controls are intuitive but will take some time to learn if you are transitioning from another system (there is no standard camera control layout).  Camera menus are intuitive enough that you will quickly learn them.  Just keep in mind, these cameras provide so many options it is increasingly difficult to maintain an intuitive menu system as mechanical controls are removed and replaced with software functionality/controls.<br /><br />Shooting with this camera is a pleasure.  The experience is similiar to using my Fuji's.  This camera does not have an optical viewfinder and instead provides an EVF (Electronic View Finder).  There are pros and cons to each.  When I made the transition from Nikon optical viewfinders to Fuji EVF's or Hyrbrid EVF's (both optical and EVF option), I was initially put off.  However, I came to love the EVF as a more accurate representation of what my output (image) would look like since the EVF incorporates camera settings for exposure, white balance, etc. in the viewfinder. The primary issue with today's EVF's (across all brands) is lag time, also called refresh rate; the greater the delay, the more frustrating.  The ZS50 does a very good job in this regard, but it does lag behind Fuji and to make it as responsive as Fuji would mean moving to the next level in pricing.  Nevertheless, many people will not notice any issues and will likely welcome the change. &#34;Average&#34; everyday shooters are completely unaffected, except for children sporting events.  However, even then, children typically move much slower the younger the age.  Pro Shooters will notice however.  Regardless, most EVF's, at this stage of development, are not suitable for fast action (think sports) photography.  This is probably more my perosnal opinion than anything else.<br /><br />The auto mode of this camera is very good for true point and shooters.  Despite the auto-mode, the camera provides the option for a greater degree of control that many pro shooters crave.  Then of course, if you are shooting RAW images, the issue is somewhat academic since you can manipulate the RAW image afterwards and change all the settings after the fact.  However, the excellent wi-fi features of this camera do not transfer RAW images wirelessly.  For 99% of poeople this is a non-issue nevertheless.  BTW- RAW images produce file sizes of about 16 megabytes.  The resolution at 12mp is more than enough in my opinion unless you are making very large reporductions beyond poster size and doing significant cropping.  Don't get caught in the resolution nonsense.  After 20 plus years of advanced shooting, it is a non-issue unless you are a pro photographer and then you would not be using this camera anyway. Increased resolution on sensors this size just add more noise.<br /><br />There are a few quirks with the camera. For example, the camera battery must be charged inside the camera.  While some may complain, if you think about it, it makes sense for this type of camera.  One less item (batter charger) to carry.  Any quirks however, are significantly offset by other features or design including the great ergonomics for right hand holders.<br /><br />Just get it.  I am rating this camera 5 stars.  I will upate if anything changes after extended use.  This camera will travel with me right next to my Fuji's."

It's very easy to use for those who want a camera they can leave in automatic but also very flexible for anyone who knows or wants to learn how to put all the manual features packed into this wonderful little camera. WiFi connects to your smart phone letting you take full control from the smart phone, I found the range was a bit short but exceptable for most needs. 1080 HD video is clear near studio quality. The Leica lens is very good, Leica makes some of the best camera lenses in the world and this one is no exception, the 30x zoom is sharp and stays that way even with the stabilizer on you can shoot some excellent fully zoomed out shots. This lens is very forgiving in low light, I often find myself turning the flash off because this lens brightens up amplifying light in darker areas. Charging is done internally, a usb charger and cable are included. I like being able to charge from any usb outlet because I have many around my house and in the car, between the regular AC outlets are 2 USB power outlets, they are so nice to have. Anyway back to this camera, it offers so many options and extras that it takes some studying to learn, things like time lapse video is available on this camera, set it up and walk away, the camera starts taking spaced photos that can be played back as video showing day into night in a few seconds, you see things the weather changing with clouds moving fast across the sky or wildlife passing by. I wonder if I'll ever really have a need for time lapse video but I have it just in case the need comes up.

In recent years in addition to my `bigger' cameras I have acquired a fondness for the Panasonic Lumix pocket cameras. I have appreciated their quality and ease of carrying around. My 2 complaints have been the zoom lens, no matter what I do, it catches some dust sooner or later that has to be cleaned out or it leaves a spot on the photo. However, my biggest gripe has been the screen which, in sunlight you cannot see or in an audience type situation has this bright screen which is distracting to anyone behind you.<br /><br />I was overjoyed to see that this camera has an eyepiece. It is easy to use. There is no switch or button to push you simply put it up to your eye and the screen darkens and you see out of the eye piece.<br /><br />The zoom lens of 30X is clear and powerful. In addition there is a control ring that when you are in zoom mode can do fine adjustment. This is an improvement when you have set the camera in intelligent auto mode and are trying to take a photo of a drop of water or a small bird on a tree branch and the auto focus is trying to focus on something else.  The stabilization works fine even at full zoom and the images are clear. In fact when I sent some photos to a friend by e-mail that I took of flowers and emerging cherry blossoms,  while walking around the Tidal Basin, she had to ask which ones were taken with my `good' camera and which were taken with my new pocket camera that I was so pleased with.<br />I also used this camera without a flash in a low light situation where a friend was giving a lecture, even without a flash the pictures came out very nicely.<br /><br />Whether you just use small cameras with an auto focus for all your photos or you use this in addition to a more `professional' camera, this is a handy unobtrusive camera that gives you so much more than any other I have used with quality results and ease of handling."

Panasonic did well by reducing the sensor pixel count to 12 megapixels from the 18 mps in the earlier ZS40. The automatic LCD-to EVF switch based on a proximity sensor is also a great convenience.<br /><br />The EVF itself is excellent. I can read clearly the shooting parameters and histogram before taking the shot. It also has a horizon level built in -- which I did not expect.<br /><br />One reviewer has given the ZS50 a two-star rating based on it not having certain internal adjustments, those for Contrast, Sharpness, Noise Reduction, etc. we often find in more advanced (and even some competing) cameras. I agree that it would be nice to have those adjustments, but still I regard this as a five-star camera: It is simply the best out there IF an eye-level viewfinder is important to you. A related plus is the availability of shooting in RAW instead of (or in addition to) JPG. As someone who often shoots RAW in their &#34;bigger&#34; cameras, this is a real plus and will let me deal with many issues, including White Balance, in post processing. But jpeg image quality is fine too in the ZS50 -- a good thing since most users will use that format with this camera (as I have so far).<br /><br />In conclusion, I highly recommend the Panasonic ZS50 if you're looking for a small &#34;beltable&#34; camera with good image quality, an EVF and flexible shooting range (24-720 mm in this case)."

I bought the Lumix LF1 for a change this month,  but hated it and it was returned. This camera has great zoom,  takes excellent pictures in low light, despite having only. 3.5 aperture, the power button is in a better position, the optical viewfinder is better than LF!, I love the adjustment dial.  Also this camera does not have useless focus ring, as on other lumixs but  a scene selector.  Note it does have WIFI, but no GPS,  and if you also own prior TZ cameras,  the batteries wont fit in this unit.  You can buy extra batteries  and a external wall charger from Amazon.  I took  outdoor, indoor and close up photos and felt quality was excellent.  For those who want a &#34;almost DSLR&#34; travel camera, this cant be beat. For travel,  I can fit in in my pocket, or in my small travel pouch under my jacket, to not attract attention..  For all of my TZ cameras I use a free prescription bottle top as a lens cap, to give added protection while in my travel case. You can spray paint them to match camera and drill a hole in it and attach a short cord to keep it handy."

And in may respects it kind of is. But for the intended audience/consumer, mostly Jpeg shooters, know that you cannot adjust sharpness, contrast, saturation, or noise reduction in camera for any of the color profiles. You can select many different color profiles, but you don't have control of those parameters.<br /><br />If that doesn't matter to you, the ZS50 is a camera that has a lot going for it, albeit for a pretty steep price- all considering.<br /><br />In an age when smartphones eat up camera sales, I think every camera designed today should give a clear distinction from smartphones- not take away the intended major advantage of a stand alone imaging device- that being image quality.<br /><br />ZS50- Shoot raw or stick with your smartphone if you want an improvement in image quality worth noticing."

Fit and finish of the camera body very good. Photo quality very good, excellent close up ability as well. And the option of using the viewfinder instead of monitor on bright days is very helpful. The only reason I don't give it five stars is this small complaint. The selection wheel on top of the camera is pretty large and easy to accidently turn to another selection inadvertently. I wish they had designed it so you could lock it on the selection you chose."

I took a chance here because Panny doesn't provide options to tweak a lot of controls in this particular camera like most cameras.  However, the results in every one of my test images were astoundingly good and probably better than anything I would have selected given the presence of those controls.  Some will view this as a negative and at first I was worried as well . . . but not now!  The images were all well balanced in highlights, shadows, color, sharpness, etc.  Panny has done a great job in balancing out the images.  The 5 Axis stabilization worked incredibly well even out to the maximum 720 distance.  Here again, I was worried the images would be soft at that range . . . again I was delightfully wrong!  Panny was smart to lower the megapixels to just 12 given the small sensor here.  Noise was not an issue in any of my test images under conditions where there was reasonable light.  No doubt at night noise will creep in at higher ISO's, but given the small sensor that is expected.<br /><br />Finally, the much improved electronic viewfinder is what ultimately makes this camera so good.  No, it doesn't quite equal my Fuji X100S EVF, but it's remarkably good.  It adjusted very clearly to my aging eyes and even worked well with my sunglasses on in bright sunlight.  My primary camera is the aforementioned Fuji X100S but I needed a small long range camera and finally I've got the perfect complimentary tool.  No doubt a full DSLR with an 800mm Hubble telescope lens weighing pounds and costing thousands would take better pictures, but for just $400 bucks I got a very nice really long range incredibly stable pocket shooter and I'm not complaining about the images at all."

At first, I'd say my opinion was in line with all the other reviews, as the camera took great pictures, had a large screen with a clear image, and the compact size was up my alley.  However, after only having it a little over a year and not really using it all that often, it got some speck on the inside of the lens which left a mark on most of my pictures.  I took it into a camera shop shortly before a trip overseas, hoping for a cheap fix, and was essentially told that with these small cameras the cost to take it apart and clean the lens would be essentially the same as getting a new camera.  The repair man made a point of mentioning that this wasn't the first example he'd seen of this, and that the Lumix cameras seem to be susceptible to this problem.  They recommended I contact Panasonic, which I did, and was advised I could send it in with all packaging and a letter explaining the situation.  Since it was past the one-year warrantee, they wouldn't replace it for free, but after looking at it they would get back to me and let me know the cost.  I'm mailing it out to see if the fee ends up being reasonable, but this is the reason for my low score.  I would say a camera is no good if it can't take clear images.  Based on the high scores of other reviewers, it seems like my problem is a low risk, but at the same time I'm pretty disappointed.<br /><br />Update 9/3/15: Well, Panasonic is certainly not trying to impress me with their customer service.  Though I sent my camera with explanation as they told me to do, they returned it back with a form and a repair estimate.  Why not email me or call me as I requested in my letter?  They send it back instead which causes additional shipping costs to both of us, assuming I was going to take them up on the repair.  The cost of the repair would be $98.64 since it's out of warrantee, which is most of Amazon's price for the camera.  Add in both shipping costs, and it's a difference of $13.  I get that past warrantee I shouldn't have expected much, but what a disappointment.  The thing was only used over two or three vacations- barely at all.  Needless to say, I lowered my rating, because as I stated before a camera is pretty worthless if the images don't come out the way you want.  I guess my next camera won't be Panasonic."

The camera automatically chooses the right setting almost 100% of the time and then you have a great photo. We have taken this camera to the Amazon, the Galapagos and the Grand Canyon (1 week whitewater rafting) and it has survived..... well sort of. We haven't dropped it or gotten it wet or soaked... no not at all. What we have though is a camera whose lens is totally covered with dust on the INSIDE. It cannot be cleaned unless I open the camera up.  Almost all shots now are full of over 10-20 dust blobs. It makes using the telephoto useless, because the blobs are huge. IPhoto will fix the blobs, but it takes time and is annoying to know that we have a great piece of technology that just cannot stand up to constant use. We've taken about 15,000 photos in 2.5 years with this camera and about 10 hours of video. The video is excellent by the way.<br /><br />Because the cost of having the inside of the lens cleaned is more than the camera is worth, I will chance taking the camera apart next week. There is a video on YouTube showing how to do it. Of course there is the chance that the camera will be useless, but that's the risk.<br /><br />The reason for the dust?  Everytime the camera is turned on and the lens comes out of the body, that action sucks in air inside the camera. If you have the camera in your pocket and the body of it has some dust on it.... then.... guess what.... the dust gets sucked in.<br /><br />This has not happened on other cameras I've owned. This is the 3rd digital camera. So... now I'm not sure if I'll ever buy a Lumix again."

I happened to catch this model on sale on Amazon for $99, so I bit. I was expecting it to be an el-cheapo camera for simple family photos, etc. I have been pleasantly surprised by the number of features and high quality photos the little thing (about the size of a small wallet) can produce.<br /><br />This camera can do panorama shots both horizontally and vertically that are quite impressive. It can also do very good quality black and white and sepia photography. Neither of these features I was expecting, and again have been pleasantly surprised by. There is also a fast lens sports photography setting for pictures you need to take in quick sequence, which is particularly good if you have toddlers on the move.<br /><br />It also has a descent power battery life but not spectacular, but the cute thing is that it comes with a USB electrical outlet converter. In other words, if you are taking it on vacation and are not going to be around to plug it into a computer with a USB power port, you can just bring the USB cord and the regular electric outlet converter and just plug it into a regular electrical outlet in any wall to charge.<br /><br />As noted in other reviews, this model does not have the settings 'wheel' on the top of the camera. By that, I mean the rotating nob that many digital cameras have that allows you to physically change the photo settings by just rotating the nob around. You have to physically go into a camera operating system interface to change the photo settings, but that is really easy to do. There is also an 'intelligent' setting that pretty much lets the camera pick the perfect photo setting itself, so you really don't have to fool with changing the settings if you don't want to. That lack of a setting wheel really does not bother me at all, but I could see how some people might be intimated by having to push a few buttons to change camera settings.<br /><br />I was also surprised at the video feature on this camera. You can record up to 30 minutes of good quality video footage with sound. The sound mic is fairly clear but not fabulous. You can even replay the video on the camera screen. This is a good feature for families that like to take short video clips of kids. You can even film a video in black and white if you have the camera set to black and white. What I particularly like is that recording video is super easy. There is a little red, recessed button next to the button you press for taking pictures. All you have to do to record video is to press that button once and it will start recording the video, and you press the button a second time to stop the video recording. You don't have to click through several screens to turn on the video record setting like in many other digital camera. You just click the red button and go.<br /><br />In total, the range of settings on this camera for an entry model 'pocket' camera are really quite impressive, though there are a few design flaws you might want to think about as follows:<br /><br />I do have two gripes though about this camera, one of which is relatively serious. The first is really more of an inconvenience in that the plug in for USB/power cord is covered by this little rubber cap that is attached to the camera. The rubber cap is attached so close to the plug in on the camera that it is a real pain to hold the little cap back and get the USB male cord plug in get into the socket on the camera. You sort of have to wrestle with it. Again, that is cosmetic, but irritating every time you have to plug the thing it to recharge it or upload pictures via USB cord.<br /><br />The other complaint I have is typical of the types of cameras like this one that has a lens that physically opens up about an inch from a flat, dormant setting when you turn on the camera. In the opening up of that lens, it can create a minor suction of air which can suck in particles of dust into the inner camera lens itself. Once those dust particles get into the inner lens, you get pictures will annoying little blobs on them. You can either photoshop out the blobs, or you have to either have a professional photography guy take it apart to clean off the lens which takes time and money, or you can do it yourself if you know how. (Youtube search 'Panasonic Lumix cleaning CCD Sensor' for several videos on how to open up the camera and clean the lens yourself with a higher end jeweler's screw driver set...just beware that if you do it yourself you will likely void your warranty).<br /><br />All things considered though, this is nice little 'on the go' digital camera with high quality pictures and a lot of higher end digital camera features for the money.  I quite like mine and use it frequently, but do beware of those two irritating design flaws."

My last 2 cameras have been the Canon A570IS and the Lumix DMC-FS7.  First, the Canon was a great camera but due to having the camera fall one too many times it died after 2 years.  Having spent over $300 dollars on the Canon and having added more children to the mix, my wife and I decided to buy an inexpensive (NOT CHEAP) camera that had great Amazon reviews.  That's when I found the Lumix line of cameras.  I spent $150 for the DMC-FS7 and thought I hit jackpot because it was absolutely awesome!!!  Unfortunately, it got submerged accidentally while on a fishing trip (my fault this time) and never worked after then.  Since I was sooo impressed with the Lumix line, I chose to go that route a second time.  I wasn't let down.  This camera, even though $50 cheaper than the FS7, is equally impressive.  I love that I can quickly take pictures and not waste my time zooming in for the close up (possibly missing the perfect shot all together).  I can just crop it or resize it exactly how I like it later.  Not only will I be able to zoom in real close, I won't have to fix any pictures while at the store, wasting the time of others.  Additionally, with the O.I.S., I can take pictures on the go without worrying about blurry pictures because of my hand shaking.  It's amazing what technology can do.  I'm definitely no professional photographer but the quality of my pictures are just perfect.  Although I've read some poor reviews, I suggest you consider the ratio of good to bad reviews.  EVERY brand of camera will have their fair share of problems; there's no way to avoid them.  I strongly recommend the Lumix line, if not this specific camera.  It's definitely worth more than I paid."

I have a nice digital that takes wonderful still shots for my jewelry business BUT it won't take a picture of anything that moves &lt;G>.  I needed a small digital (inexpensive) to take photos of the kittens I foster.  Needless to say they are NEVER still.  I did quite a bit of research before ordering this one.  I've owned Panasonic products before but never a camera. I've had it a month now and it not only takes beautiful photos and STOPS the motion (and mine) but it also takes perfect shots of my jewelry including closeups with the macro.  I never read documentation unless I have to and this camera is so intuitive I only had to check the purposes of the buttons and was on the road!  The settings are simple and easy and some even have a little scrolling marquee banner with additional info that displays with it.<br /><br />I was afraid at first that the small size would be a problem for me because I'm used to using a larger one with a grip.  No problem! I put the strap on as a precaution against dropping it, but it's size is just fine, in fact I can put it in my pocket for those unplanned photo ops if I wish.  The little case I got for it is perfect and has a caribiner style hook for your belt BUT if I went on a long trip I'd want more space for the back-up batteries and charger I also purchased.  This will definately be my travel camera!<br /><br />Don't be afraid to buy this baby.  It's a great camera even at twice the price I paid, which was terriffic!<br /><br />Happy 'shooting'!"

Loved the Nikon, but the power switch on the Nikon is a button, and when I slipped the camera in my pocket between taking pictures, the camera got inadvertently turned on, the lens opened and got jammed.  Now the lens body hangs and won't retract.  The Panasonic uses a sliding power switch which I believe is a much better design, because you can't accidentally turn on the camera.<br /><br />The Panasonic takes beautiful pictures and the battery life is good.  The Panasonic doesn't come with a separate charger, so you have to charge the battery in the camera.  I bought an aftermarket battery and charger so I can charge the batteries without plugging a cord into the camera.<br /><br />The LCD screen is very bright and clear, and viewable outside on a bright sunny day.  The shutter response is excellent.  I notice no shutter delay in reasonable day lighting.  I was in London on vacation, and I was able to take pictures of Big Ben, at night, by leaning my camera hand against a street sign.  The shutter open time was greater than a second, but the built in shake control worked very well.<br /><br />This is a very good camera for the price.  It is nice to have a camera for traveling that isn't bulky and doesn't make you stand out as a tourist."

At my point in life (67) I realize that engineering a product is all about compromise.  With that said, the FH8 is not a replacement for a worn-out high-end Cannon SLR.  It is; however, a very competent camera for the price of $120 or less.  The manner in which settings are derived is simple yet effective.  You don't need a series of menu levels to scroll through as is the procedure for most all other cameras (Cannon & Nikon).  Kudos to Panasonic for making setting the camera simple.  The iA setting is where I'll leave my camera because it does an excellent job of adjusting film speed, shutter speed, lens opening and image stabilization whether I want the flash on or off.  The FH8 does give the user the ability to adjust the megapixels from 16.1 down to .3 (for posting on the internet).  The quality of the 'Leica' lense is adequate and the digital zoom is good (amazing for a camera at this price point!).  On 8/20/12 I tried the movie mode and was pleased to note it downloaded properly to my MacBook (OX 10.4) in the MP4 format.  It downloaded to iPhoto, then was played on QuickTime software.  The only negative is the quality of either the 'Leica' lens or CCD Image Sensor or both.  Sharpness in low light without flash is acceptable but not outstanding.  In addition, the FH8 Manual & PhotofunStudio 8.0 SE (both contained on a CD supplied with the FH8) is not compatible with the Mac computers.  This is a serious shortfall!  All in all; though, for the price it's a good choice for anyone wanting or needing a very small, quality camera that is simple to operate.  I have just re-evaluated the FH-8 and because I could download the video I am upgrading the rating to 5-Stars!  Since I have just received this unit, I cannot testify as to its durability or the quality of manufacturing.  Time will be the judge on that."

I love it! It's the perfect size and even has tilt shift focus. One thing that is annoying is that the cd-rom with the owner's manual is only formatted for PCs and I have a MacBook. Panasonic should offer a way to download the owner's manual online. I ended up using my work PC so it wasn't a huge deal. Amazon also has a $6 Lumix FH series case which comes in handy. So far I am really happy with the camera and the picture quality.

At the same time, I purchased a DSLR.  I've been quite pleased with both my DSLR AND this camera-- but as far as value for the money, this Panasonic Lumic DMC FH-8 really goes the distance.<br /><br />I love all of the modes (especially the sunset mode, the food mode, the baby1 and baby 2 modes), and the video is pretty great quality and easy to use.  I also love that the on/off button and the switch for switching between shooting mode and viewing photos already taken are so easy to operate.<br /><br />The main advantage of this camera is its lightweight body.  The main reason I purchased this camera (after researching for months, reading reviews both online and off, and surveying many friends and students about cameras) is that it combined a compact body with a higher MP count.  The photos from this camera are excellent, especially for a compact camera.  It's also great for travel-- which was my second requirement for a new camera, as I was making a trip across the country to visit and to take pictures of my new niece. :)<br /><br />An extra perk is that the flash on this camera works well but doesn't tend to make my loved ones blink, as (unfortunately) the more powerful DSLR flash tends to do.<br /><br />This digital camera also does well in low-light situations.<br /><br />One of the very few drawbacks of this camera is that it tends to need recharged quite often-- although I must admit that my old compact digital camera was only 8.1 MP, so 'quite often' might be a relative statement.  It's easy to recharge, but if you travel quite a bit, I'd say to either pack the charger with you or to take an extra, charged battery.<br /><br />Overall, this camera is a solid five and a great value for the money.  I'll continue to use this camera (as well as my DSLR) to capture photos of my darling niece as well as travels for years to come, as it packs well (into a purse or a carry-on bag) and so easily records those impromptu moments I'd hate to forget. :)"

I bought a camera now because I lost my old one that used film (remember film?), I needed something to take pictures on an up-coming vacation, and Consumer Reports check rated it last year.  I am not a happy camper."

Lasership provided conflicting delivery dates.  Ordered 3 items but received none, and while customer service was polite, it was a bit demeaning.  Was told Amazon only stocked the camera case, not the camera or battery.  Amazon then offered to re-ship the case, but could do nothing about the rest.  Why not just offer a full refund - I had to ask for it.  Used a gift card and was told amount would be credited back, but have not been able to confirm that yet.  Very reluctant to do any more business with Amazon and would immediately cancel any order if Lasership was used.  Currently have $200 in gift cards and am considering re-gifting them, and any others I might receive in the future, but not to a close friend.  Camera was ordered to be used at a special occasion, had to scramble to find a replacement quickly.  Very disappointed."

I bought this one and a Canon si20.  I really like this camera for the run of the mill family shots that seem to comprise most of my photography.  We us and slr for the more professional landscape stuff.  This camera is light.  It almost feels toy like in construction.  The battery is special. something I am not fond of considering the canon uses regular AA batteries ,  But this battery seems to last a long time and it charges quickly on the portable charger.30 minutes and you are done.  The buttons on this camera are smooth which makes them unobtrusive and hard to find.  but they work and there are not too many.  The canon and this one have more capability than I will ever use.  I like the on line manual.  If it were paper it would be too big to carry.  The Leica lens on this camera seems to be OK.  There is some cropping and crinkling on the picture edges that is not noticeable on the canon.  But the difference is pretty small and with the mundane subject matter I use this for, (like birthdays, around the house stuff, maybe a picture of a cancelled check, etc. the distortion around the picture's edge is not even noticeable.All in all this is the better of the two I bought.  The canon is heavier, delays pictures much longer, and seems a bit more user unfriendly than this one.  I'd buy this for a kid's present or a gift for an older person who just wants a point and shoot with a little pizzazz but it is not for a serious photographer."

You should limit ISO max to 200/400, because of its small sensor size, to not degrade picture quality in low light situations. In a few cases, you have to adjust the saturation and hue of the whole picture, to obtain the best result posssible. The Leica lens is tack sharp at all focal lengths, producing very high detailed photos for a 12MP camera. And the controls are good enough for trouble free operations.

I LOVED this camera when I first got it.  I took over 200 pictures my first month owning the camera and everything was beautiful.  The photos where sharp, crisp, and the colors were great.  The files were overly large, but that didn't concern me.<br /><br />The battery being rechargable was something I was so excited for, and the battery life was superb!  I believe I got all 200 shots that first month on one charge.<br /><br />The only draw back at that point was low light quality was not great.  But anything outdoors was amazing.<br /><br />In July the camera just wouldn't turn on.  Not at all.  I even went out and purchased a new battery and tried that, hoping the batter had just died.  Nothing.  So I called Panasonic.  They told me to send it back to them via UPS (at my expense of course) and they'd 'review' it.  So I paid 20 dollars to ship the camera back via UPS to them in Texas.<br /><br />Now came the difficult part.  Waiting, and trying to find out information on what was going on.  I had a very hard time reaching anyone who spoke English clearly, or anyone who seemed to understand what I was asking.  I spent 3 hours on the phone one day being transferred from one customer service rep to another.  Finally, I managed to be told I was getting a replacement unit.<br /><br />About 3 weeks after my initial contact I did get a camera in the mail.  It's a refurbished model of the same exact camera.  I've had it since the beginning of August and have noticed a few problems that I didn't have with my first camera.<br /><br />1) When I have the lense extended the picture quality is 50/50.  Half the time I get a decent shot, the other half it seems like the lense shakes and I get a blurry picture.<br /><br />2) The focus on the camera is much worse than the first one.  If I have a super small item I am trying to do close up-the focus just isn't there.  I have to take the pictures further out than I'd like, and further out than I had to with the first camera.<br /><br />Neither of these are 'returnable' items, so I'm stuck with what I have.  I'm slightly feared that the camera will break right after my one year warranty is up.  The upside is if it breaks before March, it *should* be covered by Panasonic.  However, a lot of online reviews later, I just feel lucky that they covered me the first time, there are a lot of negative reviews about how Panasonic deals with camera issues.<br /><br />Overall- I think I'll be looking for a different brand the next time I need a camera."

Why? Well, for her birthday of course! Plus we didn't want to spend a lot of money on a DSLR. We researched the 'best fixed lens' camera for the 'photo enthusiast'. The Panasonic was the clear winner. And the online sample photos and video were very impressive too.<br /><br />I can estimate since we got the camera in mid-January 2010 to August 2011, we have probably taken more than 5000 photos. Early 2011 the zoom feature started to hang, and our indoor photos started to look off-color. Other than that, it's been a real good camera, and it still takes fantastic outdoor photos.<br /><br />I will say, as a professional photographer, that any of the Panasonic's will probably satisfy most of your needs. It's a good 'throw in your purse,' or 'throw in the car' camera. It's great for a 'story telling' type of camera. If you're a photo enthusiast, that likes to take photos, and you want to concentrate on subject and composition more, I will recommend this camera. If you want more, or think you might want more out of photography later, I recommend you go to a DSLR. A camera that you can change lenses on, and learn more about photography on.

I wanted something I could grip quite easliy but I wasn't ready for a DLSR yet. I did not want to learn to use a camera or have a manual focus. I did tons of research on these 'bridge' or 'hybrid' cameras and decided this is what I wanted.I wanted something as easy as a point and shoot but something a with a little more quality. I found it in this camera. I got a very good price on this one (I believe they were coming out with a 14 mp so it was on phase out). I've loved this camera and the features since the day I received it. I love the size of it. It is small enough for me to throw it in a case and toss it in my purse but not so small that I can fit it in my back pocket (which also means that it's not so small that I have to struggle to get a good grip on it to get a good picture). I love that it has a view finder (great for the days you can't see the digital display in the bright sunlight) and that it has a pop up flash. The settings are very easy to use and self explanitory. My 9 year old son is constantly using it so it's incredibly durable. Takes great pictures, has a great zoom. I'm not a professional photographer and have very little knowledge of the technical side of this camera but I can say that it takes a quality picture (with super quick shutter speed) and has a very awesome auto feature if you dont want to fuss with the settings. I think this was the right choice for me. I would give this camera more stars if I had that option. We have taken thousands of pictures with it in about 6 months. If you are looking and comparing between Kodak and Fuji (which is what I was doing) bridge cameras an you can get this one in the same price range, go for this one!!!"

My daughter enjoys it more then her camera and is often using it even though its off limits to her.  Because this camera is so easy to use I at first didn't take the time to read the instructions.  Later I learned of its capabilities when I read the instructions and now I often like to experiment.  Before I was shooting in Intelligent Auto mode, and now most of my photo's are taken with the Manual or Aperture priority settings.  My daughter has more experience using the motion picture setting then myself, but I did use it one day when target practicing and I was surprised how good the video and audio qualities were.  The display, menu, and joystick are all easy to use.  The camera has an optional EVF/LCD eye sight for those sunny days when its difficult to see the 2.7' LCD display. The pro's for me were the portability, the Leica lens quality, the 18x zoom, the 1:2.8 - 4.4 lens speed, the optional eye sight, the ease of use, price, and the general over all quality of Panasonic.  The negative aspect of the camera is that it is sometimes slow to focus and shoot.  Often I give up on a shot because it will not focus at full zoom, or will be too slow and I will miss the shot.  Setting the ISO and white balance for different atmospheric conditions is something to learn if you want to stay on top of this camera's capabilities and get a good photo.  Most of my photo's are crystal clear with great detail, but some photo's will appear weak in color and clarity, and I am not exactly sure why?  Recently I shot one photo upward at a tree and the sky was deep blue.  The next same photo the sky had a weak turquoise color? I like to set my exposure at 2 notches negative zero on my exposure setting on sunny days since I can correct the lighting on the computer.  If the photo is over exposed then its ruined.  In closing, I would recommend this camera, but if I was buying now I would either pick the Panasonic DMC-FZ35, or the Canon SX301S since they both are upgrades to this camera.  If saving a few bucks is a high priority then this is a great little camera that you will truly enjoy. I bought mine here on Amazon.com and I've never had a problems with anything I've bought on this site."

That may be true, but the FZ35 is still pretty noisy, even at low ISO's, so the difference is probably minimal. They are sharp, detailed and well-exposed, but the grain is noticeable at larger sizes...doesn't even compete with a first generation Canon Rebel on that front. So don't think the choice is between a camera with minimal noise and another with a lot of noise; neither of them is stellar. If I were to make the decision again, I would go with the FZ40 because of the improved features and increased zoom.<br />Other than that, it's still a great camera and I use it all the time. The zoom, compactness, and fantastic video implementation are wonderful. Just don't pixel-peep at 100% or you'll be disappointed."

Time after time, I see people toting around expensive cameras loaded with features they don't know how to use, ignoring fundamental photographic principles, all based on the assumption that the high cost of their camera will compensate for what they don't know.  Well, it won't.  Save money and buy a camera like this one and spend the rest of your photography budget on some good introductory classes and LOTS of time in the field practicing.<br /><br />Panasonic burst on the scene a few years ago with a line of cameras that deliver great performance at a great price AND provide wonderful feedback to the shooter before and after the shot is taken.  Controls are intuitive, zoom range is amazing and overall quality is certainly suitable for enthusiastic amateurs or even professionals who don't need to print large format images.  It's light to carry and hold and offers all the features you need for true creative control.  In a year's worth of shooting, I only miss having a true digital SLR about 1/2 of 1% of the time ... not enough to justify unless you have more money floating around than you know what to do with.  I've shot with SLR's for a long, long time, but this camera made me all but forget about them."

It is also plenty wide for all of my uses.<br /><br />I have taken probably 5000 shots in the ten months I have had the camera. It has proven reliable, and I prefer it by a wide margin to Nikon and Canon branded superzooms that relatives have bought in the past year. While I have always appreciated devices that take AA batteries, this camera far outperforms any AA camera I have dealt with. I have been at events with relatives who have AA-based superzooms, and I have been able to get plenty of shots they missed out on due to inferior cycle times of their cameras. It does not hurt that I have been able to get additional batteries for less than $10 on Amazon by shopping around for them.<br /><br />The dedicated video button on the camera is very well placed. It is a feature I have not previously had on any camera, but it is an appropriate addition to the controls.

Honestly, if a superzoom appeals to you, having a number of controls is part and parcel of the experience.

It is the best camera I have used, and I would recommend it to almost anyone looking for a full featured camera."

I thought about getting a SLR, but I travel a lot, and did not want to bother myself with carrying around lenses (and break them or lose them...). So I finally bought a FZ28 almost 2 years ago now and I love it. Great quality of images. Great programmes as well as the possibility to do everything manually. Easy to use. Small and resistant (even in a bag or backbag without a case or protection). Good flash. And great lens with a pretty wide angle.

I was going to Asia first time and I wanted to be able to take better pic than regular digital camera. I bought Lumix because I read a lot of good reviews and now I know why- because it is a very good, easy to use camera AND IT TAKES AMAZING PHOTOS. It came out to be great purchase for this price!<br />It has a great rechargable battery that last long(not like cannon, WHY ALL CANNON CAMERA AROUND $200, $300 HAVE REGULAR AA BATTERY?). If you don't want to settup each pic, there is automatic mode that works pretty good but also you can work with color settups (don't expect too much though, there are few basic ones).<br />I really liked photos taken from the car (scene mode- high dynamic) like the car was standing in one place! NEVER MY PIC FROM THE MOVING CAR LOOKED LIKE THOSE ONES. It is important when you travel and sometimes you have to take pic from the bus.<br />Pic at night were incredible!(scene mode- night scenery) I could see on the pic all the little lights that looks so charming at night and never were able to depict them on the pic before.<br />As well pic taken in low lights inside the room were amazing with NO flash needed.<br />Zoom works great.<br />I took around 2000 pic in Vietnam!! and I had so much fun with it that is became my favorite thing to do there (not for people that were waiting for me, thats for sure;-))). I have those pic now on my playstation and show it everyone interested to see beutiful and exotic Vietnam.<br />This camera is great for someone that is looking for something better then just regular point and shoot camera, that is easy to use, lighweight and good for traveling."

Other cameras I have owned in the past:<br />Olympus C720,C740,C770UZ<br />Sony DSC-H20<br />Canon SX110IS, Rebel T1i<br />Nikon Coolpix p90<br />I have never owned a Panasonic camera, mostly because I never find them used very often.  I bought an open box model from Warehouse deals and it arrived in excellent shape.  This camera is very light and very easy to pack.  I loved my T1i and believe me, I would have kept it however it takes up too much space in my carry on bag and everywhere I took it, I stuck out.  That and loud shutter(like every DSLR) can kind of make silent moments awkward.  The low light performance on this camera is just as bad as any point and shoot out there.  However that is a limitation for all point and shoots in this price range.  This is much better then the p90 in terms of picture quality.  Definitely lower noise and easier to use.  It would be nice to have a flip out screen though.  I tried the SX30is in Best buy and even though its a nice camera, the quality of pictures at high zoom just wasn't there.  18x on this Lumix is more then enough and still easy to keep it stable.  I highly recommend it. The doors open and close easily, everything is easy to get to, and it is my most favorite camera that I have owned.<br />My only complaint is that the zoom lever feels awkward. You need to put in a little more effort to zoom then on my other cameras. Its not as fluid as the P90. Maybe its me owning a DSLR for a year or so.  Other then that, excellent camera especially with the 2 barrels that you can screw things on(like a UV filter directly on lens and a flower cap on the outer barrel)"

I researched similar bridge cameras for several months before this purchase. My prior digital camera, although small, didn't have a viewfinder and I just couldn't get used to taking photos with just the LCD. I also wanted more zoom, which obviously this one has. (I wanted to stop at about 18x zoom because above that, including digital zoom, the photo gets distorted.) For its class (mega-zoom), the Lumix was the smallest size, lightest weight, got the BEST reviews from the experts and was reasonably priced.<br /><br />Although I had concerns when I read about the 'toggle', it's not as obtrusive as it sounds. It doesn't rise much above the back of the camera, and pushing it in quickly brings up all the kinds of features in a shooting mode that you can change (by moving the toggle back and forth). Ingenious! Another button allows switching between the LCD and viewfinder. The display button displays written info on the LCD/Viewfinder, like which mode you're in and what it's good for. This display can be changed, or even eliminated entirely.<br /><br />The best part -call me crazy- is that each shooting mode (and there are dozens) is not only indicated in writing but also has a colored picture icon. Further, they're animated!!  (Like the pet mode has a dog which sits, gets up and wags his tail. Too funny!)<br /><br />While you could just keep this camera in the Intelligent Auto mode, I found it was well worth it to learn all the pre-set modes. My photos are a million times better now! No more hours/days spent in Photoshop. (You could also set your own aperture or shutter speed in the modes for those.)  The LCD and photos are of great quality, as is the feel of this camera (not cheaply made).<br /><br />Good battery life, although I did get a back-up one (FYI: 7.2 volts, 650 mAh). I also purchased a protective filter for the lens. (Did I mention that lenses can be added?)<br /><br />Downsides? Only a basic manual is included; you really do need to print out the full manual from the included CD-ROM. I would have rathered a hot-shoe flash, but this camera's flash is the best in its class (27 feet!)."

I wanted an affordable, high quality lightweight camera with a good optical zoom to bring along on my adventures, specifically so I could get nice bird shots within reasonable distances.  I bought the FZ35 a year ago, and it has not disappointed. I have absolutely no photography experience and still have been getting one great wildlife photo after another with the FZ35.  The 18x optical zoom is great, and since I'm too lazy to edit my photos before posting them online, I've been using the digital zoom as well (tripod needed) for close up of relatively far animals and have been happy with the results.  I've taken this lightweight camera (some reviewers complain that it feels TOO light.  Seriously?? If it's well constructed and highly durable, what's the problem?) on multi-day backpacking trips all over the west, have dropped it on dirt and in wet snow, while skiing- many times- each time thinking that it has breathed it's last photo, but so far it always stays alive and well!  Just a bit of cleaning and back to work.  Speaking of work, I surveyed birds for a whole summer in Idaho's Nez Perce National Forest and throughout the Gospel Hump Wilderness, and my FZ35 was the official work camera of my crew.  I/we used it extensively every single day, especially during hours of intensive vegetation sampling for the Forest Service.  For this research we needed many habitat/vegetation photos, often in terrible light conditions (e.g. complete canopy cover and dark, old-growth forest stands) and the pictures turned out great.  My coworkers were very impressed with this camera, although none of us have photography experience, so our opinions regarding the quality of the photos are probably very subjective.  I haven't used the HD video too much, but have been very impressed and satisfied the few dozen times I shot video.  This camera is fantastic and does everything I want and expect it to do.  I do not wish to learn more about photography at this point in my life, and it doesn't bother me in the least that I haven't read the manual and so am not using this camera to its full potential.  This camera does an amazing job compensating for all of my photography 'shortcomings', and that's one of the main reasons I love it.  Highly recommended."

The optical image stabalizer works wonders as well and really helps when you don't have a tripod handy. The 18x optical zoom is just amazing for this price range, not to mention if you set the camera to a lower megapixel the optical zoom can even be increased further.

In bright conditions such as the desert or underwater, the lcd is completely washed-out and the best you can do is point the camera in the general direct of the target, start snapping, and hope for the best.

I like to think of myself as an amateur photographer as I have a decent eye for a good photograph. I like to have a powerful but smallish camera at hand if I come across something decent to photograph as I don't like carrying a bulky camera and all the necessary equipment around like a professional photographer all the time. When I came across this camera I thought that it would solve all my problems; I was right and wrong.<br /><br />The camera is very good when there's a lot of light to shoot with. The outdoor photographs are absolutely amazing. The wide angle lens helps capture bigger areas when shooting scenery. The colors are natural and the camera captures all the details perfectly. The HD Movie mode is brilliant. I was very impressed with the clear and crisp picture quality both indoors and outdoors when making HD Movie clips. I also like the fact that there's a separate button to record movie clips. Surprisingly, the camera is not bulky as expected for one with a 12x zoom. Even if it feels a little large at first, you will get comfortable with it as time goes by. I have largish hands so the camera doesn't feel too big for me and it fits in my jeans pocket or a jacket pocket without much discomfort. However, I'm 6'1' and I wear comfortable loose jeans. My wife, on the other hand, is petite and it will NOT fit in her jeans pocket or jacket pocket. Its more of a carry-in-your-bag kind of camera for a smaller person.<br /><br />I am not happy with the cameras zooming capabilities as it is not as powerful as I expected it to be. I expected to get much closer to my subjects with the 12x zoom, but it feels more like a 3x or 5x instead. I was absolutely disappointed with the indoor and night time photos. Every photograph I took turned out blurry or grainy unless the there was absolutely no movement of the camera at the time of shooting. I couldn't figure out the reason for all the noise till I read another review which stated that the camera takes bad indoor and night time photos when its on iA mode. It said that indoor and night time photos should be taken in another mode other than iA. I have yet to try this out. The battery life was a big disappointment too. I could only take about 200 - 250 photo's on a full charge which is nowhere as close the amount of photos I take on a day trip. I ended up ordering a spare battery and a car charger just to be on the safe side.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Good outdoor photos, brilliant colors.<br />- Superb HD Movie quality.<br />- Wide angle lens captures bigger scenes.<br />- Good sized camera, not too heavy.<br />- iA mode is useful when shooting outdoors.<br />- Easy to use controls.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Bad photo quality indoors and at night.<br />- 12x zoom is a disappointment.<br />- Poor battery life.<br />- A smaller person may feel that the camera is too bulky.<br />- High priced.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />This camera is neither here nor there; meaning that it does not do the job of being a compact point and shoot camera OR being a camera with good zooming capabilities well enough for the money you spend on it. It's better to go for a cheap point and shoot to take around as your 'just-in-case' camera and invest in a more expensive camera with better zooming capabilities for outdoor photography."

I'm not one to pamper my equipment. It gets used hard and often. As with most items I own, I use them up and then upgrade when a replacement is needed. I was so impressed with the picture quality and ease of use I just bought another ZS3. The improvements that were made to the ZS5 were not to my liking and the fact that I already had an underwater housing for my 1st ZS3 also helped in my decision. Since this is a discontinued camera I bought another one. So now I have two and am considering repairing the first. Can always use a backup."

It's easily pocket size, looks good, easy to use, and produces quality images. Unfortunately, I dropped it when taking it out of my pants pocket. It fell less than three feet to the ground, where the glass on the back broke. I can see only the tiniest nick in the glass, but about a quarter of the screen is black and the rest is nearly worthless- I can see about a third of the lines that used to show what I was seeing. If I'd dropped it from a greater height or onto a rock or something I could see it being damaged, but it was a short fall and now the camera is worthless, as there's no other viewfinder. This is way too fragile- that area should be reinforced. Just a warning- you need to be extremely careful with this camera!"

I take pictures of everything EXCEPT people.<br /><br />Features that I expect to use but haven't yet: Video.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Like most smaller cameras, the sensor isn't the best. Images turn out quite grainy at high ISOs, so I wouldn't advise that you use it in dark situations unless you have a tripod - at lower ISOs, dark situations will make the exposure time very long and make the image turn out very blurry unless you use a tripod or set the camera on a steady surface, but low ISOs greatly reduce grainy pictures.<br /><br />It's also rather slow. The autofocus refocuses when you hit the shutter button so it's not good for quick shots, and its startup time can be frustrating sometimes. But that's not a problem for me usually.<br /><br />It has a 'hi-speed burst' mode in the SCN tab that allows you to take pictures either very quickly, or REALLY REALLY quickly, depending on your quality preference. Resolution is limited to 3 MPx but that's just fine for me since that's the normal resolution I use anyway. This can be useful if, for example, you're in a car driving through trees and you see an opening ahead where you want to take a picture - you can start a high-speed burst right before you get to the gap, and it'll keep taking pictures til you release the shutter button - you can delete the extra pictures afterwards.<br /><br />The lens is amazing. I've taken a picture at a range of THREE INCHES of my jeans and you can see every fiber crystal-clear. When set to 1x zoom, the lens is very wide angle, so you can take in much more of an area with a single shot than you would expect. Or if you're going to the other end of things, you can zoom in on anything at any distance, really - the 12x zoom is excellent, and when used along with digital zoom (which sometimes happens automatically) it goes up to 23x. The optical image stabilization is very useful in this situation.<br /><br />The battery life is phenomenal. I wouldn't know the picture count per charge, but this camera lasts FOREVER before you have to charge. I would like to be able to charge the battery without taking it out of the camera, but that's just what I'm used to.<br /><br />I have three 2GB SD cards, and with my preference for smaller image sizes in order to take more, I take most pictures at 3 MPx. I frequently format the drives after uploading the images to Photobucket (I remove the card and put it in my computer's SD reader to do this) so that if I should have occasion to take a thousand pictures I can do that (and then have to change memory cards).<br /><br />Another side note is that I haven't tried most of the scene modes in the 'SCN' tab, but the ones I have tried work very well, particularly the 'Food' mode.<br /><br />Overall a very good camera for the price, with a very good lens and a very good battery life."

I had 2 digital cameras already, one being a Kodak 643 (reliable, but just okay) and the other a Nikon Coolpix S550 that was a big disappointment. Both cameras take pretty lousy pictures and video in low light, as does my Canon camcorder.  This time I read lots and lots of reviews.  I read reviews on camera websites, and I read consumer reviews on Amazon and other websites.  The Panasonic Lumix ZS3 was, hands down, the winner for the type of camera I was searching for.  I went to camera stores, too, and was told by one salesman at a major electronics store that, although his store didn't sell this particular camera, it was much better than the Canon that they did sell.  He then reached into his pocket and produced his own camera...a ZS3!  That was the deciding factor for me, so I watched the prices on Amazon and ordered my new camera in February when the price fell to $229.  I certainly have not regretted my purchase.  This camera is wonderful.  The pictures are stunning, it works well in the automatic mode, and the HD videos are great, too.  We have played videos on our 46' hi-def Sony TV, and they are gorgeous.  My camcorder only gets used now on rare occasions when I need someone to take video at the same time I am taking pictures. Despite the fact that it has a 12x zoom, the camera is small enough to pop into my purse, or even in a jacket or pants pocket. The wide angle lens is great for group or outdoor shots.  I would recommend buying at least one extra battery, as the supplied battery doesn't last terribly long.  If you are looking for a camera that is easy to use and takes amazing photos and video, buy the ZS3.  I can't wait to photograph fireworks on the 4th of July!"

A point and shoot will always be lacking in low light situations.  Some are better than others, only a select few or going to have a bright or fast enough lens to capture enough light in low light to give a quality image, and they are very expensive like a SLR and without the great zoom the ZS3 gives.<br />I decided to purchase the Lumix ZS3 because of the wide angle lens and the large zoom all in one compact camera.  Now for the reason my ZS3 fills my needs.  I needed a camera to take into situations like gathering with my family, where you are close in.  I don't like to take my SLR to restaurants, but my ZS3 fills that need.  It will take very good quality photos anywhere there is good light, but I find that the flash is not very strong.  The great thing is inside the wide angle makes it a perfect camera for close in shots that I would not use my Nikon for because of the bulk.  Outside the ZS3 is as good as any point and shoot for all over image quality and has a amazing zoom for such a compact lens.  So I use a ultra compact canon for a take everywhere with good image and great HD video, the ZS3 is with me at gatherings in close in places where the wide angle and smaller flash works best.  My Nikon SLR is inside at larger events with a fast 1.8f aperture lens,again outside with my Lumix ZS3 for landscape and with a great big amazing quality zoom lens.<br />It really depends on what your needs are, we all would love to purchase an all in one camera for all the different situations that you want to take photos in, but a SLR is not practical to take in all situations and would cost you thousands of dollars for a lens that would be bright enough to cover all aspects of photography.  The Lumix ZS3 is a affordable advanced wide angle to a large telephoto point and shoot that will give you sharp, crisp, accurate color and properly exposed photos that you will love to show off to your friends in a lot of situations.HD video is amazing with great sound. If you are like me you will be disappointed with the short battery life after using a SLR so purchasing a second battery for me was a must.<br />I hope this simple low-tech review helps, also comparing the ZS3 with the  new ZS7 I chose the ZS3 for better photo sharpness, I didn't want to use manual, I have plenty of full manual cameras.  The auto or my preference the program mode works greats for me.  I did notice in comparison that the 12Mp files of ZS7 are smaller than the 10 Mp files of the ZS3 that could mean there is more processing from the ZS7 I am not sure but some Tech could tell me.  I like the lesser processing if that is the difference.  Hope this helps."

Quality construction, portability, (fits right in my purse) great pictures, amazing zoom.  I bought this camera mainly for the zoom  as it is 12 X optical. It was a bonus that it takes incredibly good video.  Also great in low light.  The 3' display is beautiful but in sunlight, it is hard to see. Purchased an optional mini HDMI cord and watched the video and stills on the HD t.v. Beautiful pictures.  The manual for the camera is very good and the camera is very well designed.  I cannot complain about the flash.  I think it is does the job.  I think the battery is a little weak. This is a problem with most video cameras. With other cameras, I have always had to purchase an additional battery if you use video. As recommended, purchase at minimum, a SDHC card 8 Class 6.  I got an 8 and it suppose to get about 1 hour of video.  I will probably purchase another card and go for a 16.<br /><br />The software is another story.  Don't even install it on your computer.  It is the worst. Find another software program that is compatible with your computer and AVCHD Lite. I haven't found one yet and not real happy that I can't play it on my computer.  The manual which is on line also is the worst.  If anyone who reads this, has figured out how to play your video with that software let me know.<br /><br />I purchased the DMC ZS3 for $238 about a month ago and now I see that it is up to $337.  I wouldn't have purchased it at that price.  I really like the camera and no regrets.  If it wasn't for the software I  would have given it  5 stars.<br /><br />To add to this review.  I deleted the Panasonic Fun Studio Software  from my computer as it was horrible.  I purchased the Corel Video Studio Pro X3 for $49 and it works great on AVCHD lite format and my 6 year old computer. I downloaded the trial version first and then purchased the Video Studio Pro X3.  I am totally happy. It also works with Sony Vegas.  Sony Vegas is a more difficult program to use than the Corel Video Studio X3.  The Corel also looks better than the Sony Vegas.<br /><br />For more information on this great little camera, go to [...] and see all of the demos and videos taken with it. Seeing the videos will totally sell you on this camera.  Amazing for a little point and shoot."

Picture quality is amazing.  Zoom is incredible.  HD Video is also great.  The auto stabilization works great for both pictures and video.  I highly recommend this camera.

I go to a lot of concerts and my husband is in a band.  I wanted to have HD recording and be able to zoom - FAR.  I had tried a Sony but was very unhappy with the picture quality and could not zoom while recording.  The Lumix has a fantastic zoom, and takes great video!  I've used it at a few concerts and got great results.  As for regular picture taking, this is where I miss my Canon.  My Canon was the best for point and shoot - I could keep it on one setting and get great pictures in every setting.  With the Lumix I have to adjust the settings a lot.  I find that a little annoying, but as I learn the camera, it might get easier.  Point is, I will trade that for the great video and zoom on the Lumix.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the camera - I don't love it like I did my Canon, but it is growing on me."

The camera was slightly heavier than I expected, but when I used both hands to hold the camera and frame the shot, it felt perfect in my hands. The color quality is pretty stunning, although watch out for difficulty getting your colors true-to-life in subway stations and the like. The LCD screen is beautiful with accurate colors.  Noise in the pictures is a problem when zoomed in too far, but shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />The camera takes about 3 seconds to start up. There is a dedicated switch to review/shoot, which distracted me at first, but is not difficult to get used to. The factory settings for the shutter click etc. were unpleasant, but I found it relatively simple to navigate the menus the first time time and set it to my liking, and every time I use the menus, I find it easier and easier. I mostly keep my camera set on iA (intelligent auto), but I like knowing that it is not my only option. When shooting slow-ups, manually switching to macro worked better for me than intelligent macro, and so it does take some playing with, but don't forget that it is play!<br /><br />All in all, I love having a camera again. It's not perfect, but it is a lot of fun.<br />Don't forget to get a case for it, though, or you will be too nervous to carry it all of the places that a small, charming camera should be carried. I also recommend a screen protector (to guard against fingerprints), extra memory (no SD cards are included) and an extra battery for full use of your new gadget.<br /><br />Much luck, and happy shooting!"

Good picture quility, reasonably small body, when considering the zoom power of the camera.  With a few buttons and clicks, I had the camera set up and ready to go.<br /><br />Fully charged the battery, visited a friend and took about 20 pictures.  On the next day, I took the camera and continuously took picutres. The battery starts flashing red when after taking 210 additional picutres.  35 more picutres later, the battery went to completely dead.  In total, I took about 280 picutres with around 40% using flash and rarely used the zoom.  This is well short of the advertised.  I suppose it is good enough for a day trip; but I better have a way to charge the battery every night.<br /><br />The other minor issue I had was that when shooting an object at a distance, say 15+ feet, the flash is not strong enough to brighten the object.

THANK YOU Karen!../and Panasonic for making such a wonderful camera that even a novice like me can get great pictures and videos too.  Though there is a newer model brought out by Panasonic this year, I'm glad I purchased this one.  It has a higher zoom but with less MP (10).  I believe the 'new and upgraded' camera has less zoom thus sacrificing for more MP.  Unless you are going to print wall sized photos (most of us don't)I do not personally see the new model as an 'upgrade'.  The video is also quite wonderful as I captured an 8 minute humming bird' dogfight complete with zooms and the sound of their wings.  Love this camera.

I looked at the Canon SX200IS and a couple of other Lumix's and the Sony H20.  What is really great about this camera is that it takes great pictures, especially in good to great light.  I have owned this camera for over 6 months and I have made many 8x10's, look perfect, and even a 16x20, looks good, but not perfect.  In low light, you have to change the settings to night or adjust exposure or put on a tripod to get ok photos.  This, like most point and shoots, is limited in lower light.  Yes you can use the flash, but then you have a bright subject with a black background.  What you lose is the context of the picture, where it was, who was there, etc.  So, if you play around with some of the other scene modes and adjust exposure and use a tripod you can, once in a while, get a decent shot.<br /><br />+'s<br />1.The burst function works great, very fast.<br />2.The sports scene mode works very fast, too (great capture of jumping on trampoline/pool shots).<br />3.A great night scene for capturing your house with lights on at night.<br />4.HD video works well in good to great light.  Mini HDMI out is great and a must.  No special cord from Lumix to buy, just a regular mini HDMI/regular HDMI cord.<br />5.Very good picture quality with the ability to expand photos to 8x10 and 11x14 with stunning results.  16x20 if you have really good light.<br />6.One touch record button right by your thumb for HD movie.  This is great so you do not have to search for it when you want to record movies.  It goes back and forth between photos and movies seemlessly.<br />7.Good quality construction.<br /><br />-'s<br />1.As some state, you have limited control over settings.  What you need to do is change the scene mode to compensate for different settings with some exposure control, white balance, bracketing, flash, and ISO control manually.<br />2.Battery life is decent, but not great.  The good news is that the battery charges pretty quickly about 3 hours or so.<br />3.Noise when zooming in and out in HD movie so I compensate by setting the zoom first, then I hit record for the movies and then move forward or back to adjust for that.<br /><br />For $230 you cannot beat this camera.  If you need anything more than this camera, then you need a DSLR- which I am getting.  I love this camera and everyone is extremely impressed with the photos that it can produce.  Even once I get a DSLR, I will still use this camera often.  Rather than carry a camcorder and a DSLR, you can carry this and get awesome photos and movies- assuming good to great light. I have reached the limits of this camera and need some more control over aperture, shutter speed and other things that this camera is not set up to provide.  Having said that, what this camera does provide is very good and quite easy to use. Do yourself a favor and get an Extreme III SDHC card at least a class 6."

Nikon Coolpix in the ocean this past March.  It made it through my kid's first 4.5 years, but the biggest beef I had with the thing was the slow shutter speed.  Literally, people would smile, the flash would buzz, and they'd start walking away as the shutter finally fluttered.  I'd tell them to 'wait...wait...wait...for it....'  But I always got people after their expression changed.  I got the ladybugs after they'd left the leaf.  My kid's slow, cute, clumsy somersaults were executed well before the flash, and the video was often my only option to capture the adorableness.  My shaky hands (seriously, I could capture stuff on other cameras, so I knew it was mine that was so reactive to my shakiness) caused LOTS of blurs.<br /><br />I got some good shots the day I dropped that thing in the ocean (by accident.)

I took some close up of a scabiosa flower, and zoomed in, and caught a tiny little semi-microscopic mite in the middle of the pollen.  My kid's smiles are caught in a fraction of a second.  My hand shakiness is virtually unnoticed.  I shot a duck on a pond about 500 feet away, and was able to zoom in to see the eye, and the feathers around the eye, and only these were slightly blurred.<br /><br />I love this camera.

We took it to Disney World for Spring Break '10 and loved the pictures. The battery life was amazing compared to any other point and shoot I've seen. Pictures are really sharp. We've used many of the different settings. It also takes unbelievable macro pics and you can get within a few inches of an object if you use the iA setting (on the dial). We also took many videos and were very impressed with the high def quality and the one-button start for the video. We used a 8MB class 4 SD card and still had room on the card after all week taking 637 pictures (998MB) and 23 videos (758MB). We only charged the battery once that week. It's a little hard to hold the camera steady when you zoom all the way in (12x) but that is to be expected. The higher the zoom, the more steady you will need to hold a point and shoot camera. Watch for the out-of-the-box settings of 10MB per pic. Most people don't need that and it'll fill up your card quick. I'd recommend changing that setting unless that's REALLY what you want. As all point and shoot cameras today, you'll need to use a tripod if you intend to use fireworks settings or similar. But the lens on this camera (Leica) is very high quality - very sharp and crisp. This is a much better point and shoot camera than my daughter's old Nikon Coolpix L12 or my husband's Nikon Coolpix S550."

My old Canon sureshot was great, but I wanted a larger zoom and a smaller size. After much research, I opted for this one over a similar canon SX200is. I got the camera (shipped) for under $250, and I'm still amazed at what it can do, at how well it does everything, and that it does it all in such a small package. Being new with the camera, I mainly used the intelligent auto function, and it worked very well, allowing me to take clear shots at full zoom without a tripod (all from a safari jeep).  I also shot some short HD films, which were pretty jittery (because of me, the jeep, and the amount of zoom) but amazingly sharp with passable sound. Keep in mind that your ability to take a fluid video will depend on the speed of your camera card (I used budget cards claiming class 8 and 10, and had good results overall, but there where a few pauses here and there probably due to write speed). While not the smallest camera you can get, I kept this camera in a shirt pocket often, which is amazing considering that it has a lens set up that goes from 28-300ish mm. Also, now that I'm not in Africa, I'm so glad it has the wide angle lens, which is what most of us need most often. It does eat batteries when under heavy use (but not so much when used sporadically) so I carefully researched and bought two extra after-market batteries for under $20 each (be careful to read reviews to see if you are getting the right battery) and both worked fine. I ended up using only two batteries per day on safari, but it was nice to know the third was there given the gravity of the trip.

Software? - go shoot yourself!,"<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Panasonic-Lumix-DMC-ZS3-10-1-MP-Digital-Camera-with-12x-Wide-Angle-MEGA-Optical-Image-Stabilized-Zoom-and-3-inch-LCD-Black/dp/B001QFZMCO/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3 inch LCD (Black)</a><br />For all the good reasons given in other reviews this is a great camera for its purpose, really fabulous actually except for that crummy flash.<br /><br />The reason I would probably never buy a Panasonic camera again is the atrocious software. Ever time I have to start that accursed software I just lose heart and I just wonder why Panasonic is such a complete dud at creating the photo handling software. It's just a complete frustrating mess.<br /><br />The main purpose of the software seems to be to give you lots of warnings about not daring to touch any photos on the camera without using the software or you will not be able to access them again - you've lost them! That's true because I did in frustration move some photos in the usual drop and drag way and I lost access to the whole memory card and had to reformat - that's what they tell you so it's true.<br /><br />But who the heck are Panasonic and what past age are they living in to tell you that you cannot access any of your own digital property without using their mind-draining software. It's totally beyond me, yet noone in the reviews seems to mind???<br /><br />For example, you want to transfer the pictures taken since you last painfully started their software? Go jump, no such function, best you can do is try to remember what you transfered last time and then untick everything and then tick one by one the new photos. You want to tick the first in the series to be transfered and then the last, the usual 'shift-click' - sorry it doesn't do that. Work your way through one by one click by click you sucker. You want to play their video? Yes it's great HD but their own format<br /><br />As for the people saying how great it was to upload to Youtube and Facebook I am stunned. How does that work - the Youtube uploaded has failed every time at the END of every upload I have tried to make. The format is not recognized by Youtube to be uploaded directly. The sizes are too big for Facebook. And the software warns you at every step that if you touch a file or change a name of anything in any movie folder then you will lose the lot. Is that what you want to risk of all your vids of your newborn child????<br /><br />This Panasonic crowd are locked into a prehistoric mindset of locking you into their formats and software, and woo will befall you if you attempt to use your normal IT skills to access and edit your own digital content, stills or videos. I find it appalling and as I said enough to almost certainly ensure I never buy another of their products.  I just hate every time I have to connect the camera to my computer.<br /><br />Just to round out the perspective I am putting here, I did say that I really love the actual camera it is quite remarkable. But not remarkable enough to overcome the frustration and fury of using their software."

My daughter's school was putting on a play and I could not get a good picture at all using the automatic settings.  I did however get some great video with the AVCHD lite.  It works very well even in a low-light environment and the ability to zoom in and out while recording is excellent.  This camera completely replaces our Sony video camera which seldomly got used due to its size and inconvenience.  After the dismal pictures of this play, I was ready to return the camera and try again.  But, I decided to give it another chance (and also play around with selecting the right scene modes manually).<br /><br />We took it on a trip to Disney and with the 12x zoom were able to capture some of the shows/parades as though we were on the front row.  The camera's auto-focus tracking was excellent and the pictures are very crisp, clear and colorful.  I was most impressed on the safari ride in Animal Kingdom where I as able to capture the animals very close-up all while riding in a vehicle bumping along the path - I was never able to do that with my Sony PS200 (which I had always been very happy with).<br /><br />The LCD is crystal clear and very large which is great for seeing what you're getting.  It is a little difficult to see in the bright sun, but that must just go with the territory.<br /><br />The one downside is that the battery life does not seem to be nearly as long as with my old Sony (it could go for days on a charge).  After a good day of use, this camera definitely required charging.  I'm sure the large, bright LCD and the autofocus do require a lot of power.<br /><br />All-in-all I've been very happy with my purchase.  Hard to believe all the technology and quality you can get for $250."

The videos and stills are both excellent. I agree with the common dislikes of other reviews; need more manual controls, mode selector wheel moves to easily, software could be better. However, these are all pretty minor issues for me, and probably most people.<br /><br />I bought this hoping to replace both my old digital camera, and video camera. I believe I was successful. I took a 2 1/2 week trip, took plenty of videos and photos, and the results were fantastic. I didn't have to lug around 2 devices, and the camera is very pocketable.<br /><br />My only complaint was the battery would not last a complete day. But this was a heavy sight seeing trip with lots of video and pictures. I tried to order an extra battery before my trip, but they were back ordered everywhere. Since the trip, I haven't had a battery issue, so I still don't have an extra.<br /><br />I noticed this model is in some Costcos now. So if you can't wait for online orders, go get it there.

It is replacing my previous Sony H5 which had replaced my Olympus C3000Z which had replaced a Nikon taking exclusively color slides.  Main reason for replacing the Sony was its tremoendous appetite for AA batteries, rechargable or not.<br /><br />This Lumix is wonderfully compact and fits into a good sized shirt pocket.  I had expected a snapshot point and shoot camera but it is so much more, I find myself using it for 'everything', including tripod and night scenes.  It allows at least the same diversity as the Sony, the still image quality is at least as good, the movie quality considerably better.  Still image and movie quality are not quite as good as with my daughter's Nikon D90 but I guess that's an unfair comparison.<br /><br />The Lumix has a VERY useful Zoom range, down to equivalent 25mm and up to equivalent 300mm.  From real wide angle family shots in the house to far away animal life and scenery.  It releases faster than both of my old cameras, especially in bad lighting needing flash.  Repeat time is fast, also with flash.  The User Manual is very descriptive and easy to understand.  Settings are intuitive and straightforward, and allow a wide range of customization including selection of various AF dominants as well es metering areas, plus a large variety of scene modes, also face recognition.  It does not have a view finder but the large viewing screen is quite bright and usually sufficient.  About the only thing I would wish for is a remote release, but it does have a selectable self timer, 2 or 10 sec.<br /><br />Summary:  I would definitely buy it."

The Lumix ZS3 is the best point and shoot I have ever owned (and I have owned about 6 of them). Now, mind you, I said 'point and shoot'. It is not going to perform like my Canon DSLR or even my Panasonic LX3, but as the saying goes, the best camera is the one you have with you. The ZS3 is very portable, takes crisp, clear pictures outdoors, and had great reach. When I'm using this camera, I'm not looking for complete manual control or taking Raw images. The sensor in this camera is point and shoot size, so you will get noise if you crank up the ISO too high. Indoor shots taken with the flash come out looking too overexposed and washed out like all onboard flash pictures. I only try to use the flash as an outdoor fill flash. I'm looking to purchase a second back up ZS3, because I would hate being without one. I have used mine for 2 years without any kind of mechanical failure and it still performs like new. These cameras are becoming harder to find, but if you have the opportunity to buy one, do it. It's a great camera.<br /><br />Update: I was able to buy a lightly used backup ZS3 and this one works as good as my original. Love it!"

I've had it over 2 years now and it has never failed. I am looking for an upgrade however I am struggling to find something that impresses me after owning this. I have experience with numerous DSLRs from various brands like Olympus and such so I think I know quality. This god damn camera beats alot of DSLRs out there in picture quality. I found this astonishing as I always had the belief that only DSLRs could produce such quality photos and to see it  beat a few was puzzling to me. I personally think Panasonic accidentally make this cam cuz its no way they intended it to be as good as it is. My ex-boss had a thousand dollar Olympus DSLR and he was upset at how comparable my photos were to his. The only thing his had over mine was the manual focus which adds that luscious looking dept of field blur. My camera does it too almost with the same effect.<br />Also I devised a trick that solved the low/no light issues, the camera only uses the red light when focusing even in pitch black so I allow it to focus by holding it close to an object mostly on the ground and when it focuses I then hold it up at my target and it then flashes and takes a perfect daytime quality pics.<br />I will post pics I have taken with this camera in daytime and also pitch black, you WILL be impressed."

I got my wife a zs7 but after some research, decided to get a refurbished zs3 for myself.  At the time this was a top-5 camera among panasonic cameras on the FLICKR website, and still even today, it's in the top-10, even after being discontinued half a decade ago!<br /><br />This camera's 12x zoom and 12MP sensor produces pictures that are as sharp as a needle.  You cannot get a good picture without a sharp lens.  I'd wager this is the sharpest zoom lens above 10x that has ever been shipped on any travel zoom (including sony and canon and all later panasonic cameras).  This is VERY SIGNIFICANTLY sharper than anything Canon has ever made in a pocket camera!  I say this having owned the successor lens in a ZS15 (16x Leica), and also having purchased SLR lenses for their sharpness for Pentax and Nikon cameras, and my wife having owned a Canon G2 camera.<br /><br />The intelligent auto is amazingly smart and wicked fast (1.4 secs to turn-on and 0.4 seconds shutter lag).  It takes sunset photos and gets optimal details BELOW the horizon, where you have to set a special exposure otherwise the sun blows out the highlights everywhere else in the photo.  The focus system is superb and normally gets at least 2/3 of the frame in perfect focus, which leverages the exceptional power of the tack-sharp lens.<br /><br />The sensor is very cleverly made in a + shape so that no matter if you are shooting 4:3 or 16:9 photos, you have the maximum number of pixels available to get a quality photo!<br /><br />We used this camera nonstop for 2 years to photograph and shoot video in soccer tournaments and swim meets.  The camera was used with a tripod for the soccer tournaments, and some of the 720p video was superior (more saturated and realistic-looking) than that of a $5,000 Canon rig that the professional videographer dad was using.  And, this is because Panasonic (and Sony) specialize in Video, so their cameras pan and zoom without the stabilizer trying to 'hold on' to the photo (resulting in very jerky pans and zooms in other cameras, such as Canon).<br /><br />Unlike some other cameras, this one can do motorized zoom while filming (not just digtal magnification like in most crappy canon pocket cameras.)<br /><br />The trick to getting optimal photos is to set ISOMAX=800 and intelligent everything, and then let the stabilizer clean up your photos.  This forces the OIS to work much harder than normal.<br /><br />The main downside to this camera is that in low light, it produces a great deal of yellow color noise, i.e. yellow splotches in dark areas.  People install the GIMP (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) freeware program and add the 'Wavelet Denoise' add-on.  Then you can post-process out the color noise.  The ZS7 fixed the color noise problem but it has too much processing and too much pixel detail was lost.  You can get almost as good a photo on the ZS7 if you turn down the processing algorithms to minimum.<br /><br />The other downside is that the photo mode wheel can get stuck between two settings and the camera won't take pictures for a moment when this happens.  It's a very minor annoyance that only happens if you are switching modes al the time.<br /><br />There is still not a point and shoot camera (circa 2015) that can take a sharper photo at 12x zoom than this model.<br /><br />I lost my zs3 so today I use a zs15.  The later 16x and 20x and 25x and 30x lenses are all declining in sharpness, and especially doggy were the zs8, zs9, zs10 CCD cameras, so stay away from these cameras!.  My new zs15 has a very special FZ200 CMOS sensor and so it takes much better night photos than the CCD in this ZS3 camera, and it was an attempt by Panasonic to salvage its reputation after the horrific failure of the zs10. The zs15 is almost as sharp as the zs3 but I cannot take pictures 25 feet away in a daylight room with lights off and read the book spines, like I can on the zs3 or zs7 with processing turned down.  The lack of a CMOS sensor in the zs3/zs7 camera is its only disadvantage, and it's a minor disadvantage compared to what you get for advantages in picture sharpness and fluid movie-taking."

It's spy and adware which is installed in a manner so as to make it nearly impossible to uninstall, using hidden components, fake names and so forth. It then puts up ads on your desktop (over any running application) and reports various bits of data to a nondescript server (seemingly run by the software developers and not by Panasonic, based on the IP address).<br /><br />If you do install Panasonic's software, I highly recommend re-installing your operating system as it's the only way I know of to be sure you have removed all traces of the spy and adware. It is worth noting that Panasonic went through extra hoops to ensure their software was able to perform similarly for both Windows and Mac OS X (yep, OS X is not immune to trojan software like this!)."

The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 is my favorite point & shoot camera so far.  I have just recently bought my 2nd Lumix DMC-ZS3, a refurbished camera.  My old DMC-ZS3, which is 3 years old and still working perfectly, has a small scratch on the lens.  Also, it has been beat up - carried around in my pocket for years, especially when gardening which can get dirty and dusty, and I wanted a 'like new' camera.<br /><br />The Lumix DMC-ZS3 has a large LCD, an attractive metal body that feels and looks like quality construction, and the settings are easy to program.  It takes decent video, although I haven't tried the HD setting.  Even at the Intelligent Auto setting, it takes amazing photographs of outdoor landscapes; good macro shots, and the zoom is powerful enough to capture nice pictures of wildlife like birds or butterflies.<br /><br />A friend of mine also has this camera, and and I offered to buy his camera off of him, but he wanted to keep his, even though he has an iPhone 4.  He is an avid skiier and he can carry it while skiing and take nice shots of the mountains.<br /><br />The biggest con with this camera (in my experience) is that the flash seems to be somewhat weak in low light settings indoors.<br /><br />Some day soon I hope to buy a DSLR, and learn more about photography, but for a camera you can carry in your pocket, pull out and take quick shots, without thinking too much about it, this camera is the best!  Highly recommend."

It produced wonderful pictures during that time.  This camera was treated well and kept in a case when not in use.  It was not taken to the beach where it would get sand in it or used in an abusive manner.  We used it mostly indoors for family photos.<br /><br />About 3 weeks ago we started having problems.  When the camera was turned on the lens would extend and retract several times and then finally close.  A warning was displayed stating 'System error (zoom).' At first we thought it was the battery and replaced it.  The same thing happened.  Thus we called Panasonic and found out to have the camera repaired it would cost $180 through a company in Texas (no one answers the phone).  This is approximately half the cost of a new camera of the same model.<br /><br />Another family member, who purchased one around the same time, also started having problems with their Lumix DMC-ZS3.  First when previewing taken pictures, the lens would not retract and close but stayed open.  Additionally, when taking a picture, the lens covering would not completely open and had to be manually moved so as not to create a shadow on the picture.  As above, the cost for repair was $180.<br /><br />Looking online, it appears that these issues are not isolated and have frustrated many.  Paying $400 for this camera to have it basically become inoperable 2 years later is unacceptable.<br /><br />In contrast, we have two Canon point and shoots that we have used over the last 5 years with no problems at all.<br /><br />I have voiced my disappointment in an email to Panasonic.  Not sure it will do any good.<br /><br />We post these comments so that others may be warned.<br /><br />We will not be purchasing another Panasonic product after this unfortunate experience."

First,,you must push the button down half-way to focus first , before you take the picture.  Make sure you take macro mode off each time you use it(it does not turn itself off and will get you blurry pictures left on).

I changed my order to blue online , but got the black one, and didn't want the hassle of bringing it back.  You can use an aftermarket battery, but you have to rollback the camera software to 1.0 instead of 1.1.(i think those numbers are right).

The ZS3 is brilliant value for money and I am delighted that I took the time to read the reviews and I have ended up enjoying every momento I have recorded with this fantastic little camera.<br />At a similar time to when I bought this camera my sister purchased a samsung camera with 2 screens, touch screen, 12.1 MP and a 5x Optical Zoom. It was pathetic in comparision and I think she regretted buying it. Some cameras may have appeal with all the extra features but I honestly think that this camera is 10 times better than your average digital camera.<br />I was very suprised to see that some people had been disappointed with this camera. As I said mine has lasted two and a half years now and i'd be suprised if it didn't keep going for another two. My only critisism of this Lumix camera is that when you're taking extremely detailled, close up shots the focus can be a bit frustrating to perfect. However, I found that with a little perserverance the photos can be beautiful.<br />Despite this I would recommend the ZS3 to anyone from the budding photographer to the average tourist.

My only complaint is that it is very difficult to keep tiny grains of sand or dust out of the seal, and this camera is very sensitive to any little thing in the seal. I have used it snorkeling in the bay and to get pictures on land. It works great for both, but the seal is difficult to keep clean. I had an Olympus camera before I bought this one, and the Olympus was much easier to keep clean. The Olympus would not work if there was sand or dust in the seal, but I did not have a problem with either getting into the seal. It was also relatively easy to clean the seal area. It is pretty difficult to get sand out of the seal on this little camera. I need a needle and a magnifying glass to do it, because ANYTHING in the seal will mess up the camera. That said it takes great pictures, but it is very difficult to keep the seal clean."

I bought the TS25 knowing it was a moderately priced point-and-shoot, but wanting something I could easily carry in my life jacket while kayaking.<br /><br />That said, I was disappointed by the quality of both stills and video from this camera. Stills are often somewhat noisy (&#34;grainy&#34;), with fairly obvious JPEG compression artifacts. Video is not especially sharp either, and the audio has a nearly continuous buzzing/chittering noise in the background, apparently from the automatic focus motor. If you were shooting video of anything quiet with this camera, I think you'd be very unhappy with the unwanted noise that the camera contributes to the soundtrack.<br /><br />So... yes, it's small, fairly rugged and water-resistant (although I haven't tested it underwater). But neither photos nor video are as sharp as you'd want them to be, and that motor noise in the videos can be very annoying. I have not tried other cameras in the &#34;rugged point-and-shoot&#34; category, and maybe this is the best you can expect for a couple hundred bucks. Just don't expect too much from it."

Otherwise the use of the camera is pretty standard.  I will attach some photos we took on our mini vacation. I think you will love this camera!

Takes very nice pictures as long as lighting as adequate. It doesn't do well with low light. Or maybe I just didn't have long enough to figure it out because within a month I took the camera on vacation to Florida...in a nice padded case.  I did have it out on the beach the first day for all of 5 minutes or so.  It wasn't windy.  I wasn't near the water.  It was in the case - came out to take a few pictures - and went back in because the rain was coming so we left as soon as we got there.  We went from there to Epcot where I took a number of pictures before sitting down that evening to watch a musical show.  I was zoomed in fairly close and had taken maybe a half dozen pictures when the lens suddenly went blurry as if the camera had lost focus.  Lens kept going in and out repeatedly trying to regain focus and then I was prompted to power off and restart the camera.  Once I did I got the dreaded focus error that several others have talked about.  Nothing helped - not powering off, not removing the battery, nothing.  Each time I power it back on the lens automatically retracts all the way into the camera then extends all the way out and the error appears again and the camera shuts off.  It was not jarred and nothing got in it.  I was very careful due to the comments I'd read already but hello, it's a compact camera with a powerful zoom, not something made for a portrait studio. It's made to take with you when you live life.  Mine lived a month and now I'm sending it in and hoping it will be covered under warranty."

I didn't want to spend more than $200 on one and I wanted one with a fairly good zoom.  Everything I researched kept bringing me back to this camera.  At the time there were only about 10 ratings on it but they were mostly positive.  Here's what I've found with it and I've had it for almost 7 months now:<br />Good:<br />-It takes nice sharp landscape pics without zoom just fine<br />-It has a wide angle, unlike most cameras of this size (which can be good and bad)<br />-The panoramic is awesome and does a very good job of stitching<br />-Battery life is ok, not fantastic<br />-It is small and easy to carry<br />-It's been reliable, had no issues with it except recently with a spot on the lens which I just tried cleaning last night and haven't tested today<br />-Easy to navigate the menus<br />-Has enough creative controls to keep you happy<br />-Video quality is ok but if you walk around with it, it will be shaky and zooming takes a long time.<br /><br />Bad:<br />-The zoom is horrible.  At full zoom the pictures are completely grainy.<br />-Image stabilization?  None here.<br />-You can't zoom in on anything that's close to you without it being blurry.  You have to get the camera right up next to the thing you want to photograph and even then, it's not guaranteed it will be out of focus.<br />-It's hard to tell on the preview if your photo is blurry or not without zooming in on it.<br />-The microphone is in a horrible place for shooting video.  It's right where you hold the camera so I often find I can't hear anything because my finger was covering it.<br />-I have to take the videos into Free All Converter before posting it on YouTube due to the incompatibility...that's horrible.<br />-Night time pictures simply don't come out...they are completely dark and grainy if not using the flash.  Even under typical to dim lighting conditions inside.<br />-If you want to do a long time exposure you only have 3 choices for the time...better have a tripod.<br /><br />I really would love to get a different camera.  I just think that $200 should buy you more than this.  It's caused me to not even want to take pictures anymore unless it's something fabulous which is a real bummer.  It seems like no matter how long you wait, a good camera never gets any cheaper.  This is more like a $100 camera to me, which is why I spent the extra $100 thinking it would NOT be that.

The picture quality does not reflect the supposedly better resolution.  and be prepared for indoor shots to either be a bit dark or noticeably washed out. And it's cheap.  Cheap body, cheap USB port cover, cheap lack of a charger, cheap lack of features... even the USB cord is thin, short, and cheap.  I've gone back to my old camera, scrached lens or not.

I purchased this camera based on the reviews given on Amazon.  It seemed to have alot of positive reviews, so I went forward and purchased the item.  I have owned a Panasonic lumix point and shoot, for many years now, and decided to upgrade.  I currently have a 7mp camera, (from 2006) and wanted to upgrade to 16 mp or higher.  I purchased this camera, and when I first tried this camera out, the images gave off a weird distortion & slight blurriness of images.  I thought to myself, o.k. let me go back and read the instructions again. So, after reading and playing around with the features I was still getting a blurriness and distortion in my images.  Some images were even showing a type of noise or spots in background.  So, I figured I was doing something wrong.  I called up Panasonic customer support.  Well, after being on the phone for over an hour an half, the customer support agent said that I could return the camera for another one or return the item to the store.  So, obviously I asked the customer agent if that verifies there was something seriously wrong with the camera.  They couldn't verify, what was wrong with camera.  So, I returned the camera back to the store and got my money back.<br /><br />WHAT I REALLY NEEDED THIS CAMERA FOR:  I only needed the camera to take images of merchandise, inside my house, in low light settings primarily for my online eCommerce stores on amazon & ebay.  Apparently, doing this simple task was too much for this camera.  I personally didn't try taking images outside.<br /><br />So, in final it was disappointing.  I was a huge fan of Panasonic and I guess you get what you pay for... But, I just can't see spending $1000+ for a camera to take simple images indoors.  I'll have to keep searching, as there has to be a decent digital camera, at an affordable price.  Happy Holidays everyone."

Crisp, sharp photos (and videos) with no blurr<br />2. ease of use; very intuitive with a lot of features<br />3.

The Lumix is a much better product [remember comparing older tech however; the Coolpix was only 6 megapixels], as the coolpix was a solid no frills 'auto' device, but this Lumix is a sophisticated machine offering both simplicity and functionality...and some override for manual control for real photo buffs.  And the ZOOM is superlative.  The zoom reminds me of my old 35 mm SLR film system telephoto lens etc.  Amazing now we have this at the touch of our fingertips on small pocket sized cameras like this Lumix.  The coolpix I thought was nearly indestructible until that latch broke but only after years of use and abuse.  We'll see if that Lumix holds up as well, or better.  For now, I feel really good about this purchase and really like this camera [the Lumix]."

And the DSC-W730 is the lowest priced Sony that comes with a Carl Zeiss-licensed lens. Leica and Carl Zeiss are legendary German photographic lens designers who are known for their super sharp and accurate color lenses. Not all Sony and Panasonic cameras have Carl Zeiss and Leica marking on the lens, respectively. Those that do not cost less, but I always choose ones that do.<br /><br />I have both of the above cameras and like them very much because they take excellent, sharp, color accurate pictures without costing a lot of money. The Panasonic costs a bit more, but both are excellent.<br /><br />The Lumix SZ3 has a slightly greater zoom range of 10X, compared to Sony's 8X. Both cameras have the wide end of the zoom lens at 25mm (35mm film camera lens equivalent), which is great for group and scenery shots.<br /><br />I prefer the SZ3 camera's physical user interface, especially the direct 'movie button' and the shutter button surrounded zoom lever. They are more convenient and easier to use than Sony's.<br /><br />The SZ3 shoots video in 720p at 24 frames per second (fps). Some users like this frame rate because the resulting video looks more film-like, or movie-like than when shot at 30 fps or higher.<br /><br />I buy extra compatible batteries on eBay. For the SZ3, you can typically get 2 new batteries, with free shipping, for about $13. Just search 'Panasonic SZ3 battery'.<br /><br />The black version of the SZ3 also comes equipped with a black-colored lens barrel - a rarity these days. IMHO, it makes the whole camera look better/more consistent.<br /><br />If you need a carrying pouch for this camera, I'd recommend Case Logic's DCB-302 (less than $6)&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Case-Logic-DCB-302-Compact-Case-for-Camera-Black/dp/B003F7DWH8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Case Logic DCB-302 Compact  Case for Camera - Black</a>. Its size is just right for the SZ3, with a few centimeters of extra space so it isn't too snug. The small accessories pocket is perfect for memory cards and batteries.<br /><br />Instead of using the pouch's shoulder strap, I urge you to tie the camera's wrist strap to one of the two shoulder strap ringlets, so that the camera and the case are loosely tied together. The arrangement permits me to hold the case with my left hand while I take pictures with my right hand. If someone bumps into me at this moment, my camera is less likely to fall to the ground, as its wrist strap is tied to the case held by my left hand."

My only complaint -- and this is pretty big to me -- is that it does not come with an actual, hands-on manual.  Rather, everything is on the computer.  You download the manual and the PhotoFunStudio program.  I don't know about you, but if I find myself in the middle of Bryce Canyon, or some place equally stunning, and have to try to figure out how to use a feature of my camera, that's going to be pretty darned inconvenient.

It is a very nice compact camera. I read the reviews carefully for a number of compact models on Amazon, Cnet and elsewhere. Panasonic seemed the best in this category so I went with the recent model. We are very happy we did. We are happy with Canon for larger, more serious cameras but for compacts Panasonic seems best. This is certainly better than the Canon it replaced.<br /><br />The response time to click and shoot is very short compared to other compact cameras we have had. The picture quality seems excellent in 'Intelligent Auto'. It is flexible if you want to customize your shots with several built-in photo types and also freedom to adjust yourself. The 10X optical zoom is very good, too. [Note: goes to 20X with 'digital zoom'. Pictures look fine but I think it is more meaningful to compare the optical zoom. 10X is very good for a camera this small.]<br /><br />The only thing that we have any trouble with is the 'panoramic' feature that stitches several pictures into one wide one. It is not a feature very important to us the but the couple of times I have tried it I had trouble getting it to work. It said they camera was not moved horizontally enough to work.<br /><br />Other than that, it is very easy to use. The buttons are well-located and the menus are clear and easy to navigate. Overall, we are very happy with this camera."
Panasonic,Panasonic Lumix DMC-SZ3 16.1 MP Compact Digital Camera  with20x Intelligent Zoom (Black) (OLD MODEL),20130605,B00ATE7SZM,4,55,56,"on June 5, 2013",ANONYMOUS,"Simple to use, takes ""OK"" photos - Panasonic SZ3","Although I love the styling of the new XS1 Panasonic camera&nbsp;<a class='a-link-normal' href='/Panasonic-Lumix-XS1-16-1-MP-Compact-Digital-Camera-with-8x-Intelligent-Zoom-White/dp/B00ATE7W0I/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk?ie=UTF8'>Panasonic Lumix XS1 16.1 MP Compact Digital Camera with 8x Intelligent Zoom (White)</a>&nbsp;and came close to ordering that model, I chose the SZ3 instead. The reason I chose this camera instead? The XS1 uses a micro-SD card, those little tiny cards smaller than a fingernail that are normally used in cell phones (and some Samsung cameras!). Since I like to remove my SDHC card to get my photos off via a card reader, I chose the SZ3 instead since it uses the normal SDHC card. I recommend getting a Class 10 card for this if you plan on shooting videos.<br /><br />Even though this has a CCD sensor instead of the newer CMOS sensor found on more & more cameras nowadays, I can't see much difference in speed. It is quick to turn on and be ready for a photo, quick to recycle after taking a photo, burst speed is fast enough to keep me happy.<br /><br />Photos are true to color, although similar to other Panasonic cameras, a little 'soft'. This can be remedied by keeping your setting on Vivid (normal setting) to increase sharpness. This has a Leica lens, known for being one of the best lenses available.<br /><br />Plenty of scene settings, even for pets. Most of the time though, I can get a better pet photo with the setting iA (Intelligent Auto mode).<br /><br />A *major* disappointment is the lack of the Quick Access Menu button as other Panasonic cameras have. It also falls a little short on macro shots. I get better close-ups with some of my other cameras; at the same time, those cameras cost more.<br /><br />Low light: No matter what the camera manufacturers say, not only Panasonic, but the others, you can't expect a camera in this price range to be good in low light. It's just not gonna happen. Now if you're in a dimly-lit restaurant and use a night scene setting with the flash, yes, you'll get a decent photo, but if you expect anything more, you'll be disappointed. In that case you need a camera 4 to 5 times the price of this one such as the Sony RX100.<br /><br />I love the Creative Control options with this camera, this seems to have more options than some of the other camera models. My friends and I are having a blast with the 'Beauty Retouch' function! You can retouch a photo to give yourself a more glamorous look, even a smokey eye!<br /><br />Battery life is decent, I can get around 200 photos and a couple videos before the battery needs recharged. As far as recharging, the battery is charged INSIDE the camera like a lot of others these days. You can charge it by your PC or by plugging the cord into a receptacle.<br /><br />Build quality: It's plastic, but seems to be durable for a cheap camera. No matter how much one spends on a camera, the battery doors are always flimsy, so just take extra care when opening it. This camera is on the smaller side, but not 'too small' and the controls/menus are easy to access even with chubby fingers. The LCD screen is a tad smaller than most, but seems to not have as much glare in the sun. One downside is this camera is made in China, while most of my other Panasonic cameras were made in Japan, even those that were similar in price.<br /><br />As far as video, some may think it's a 'con' that this only records 720p, not 1080p. Frankly, I can't tell much difference between the two when I view them on my computer on YouTube, however, you may see a small difference if you watch the video on a TV. My computer is 5 years old and doesn't handle 1080p very well, it's a little quirky.<br /><br />I recommend this camera, even though it's a basic point & shoot with very little manual control. Sometimes I favor ease-of-use and the ability to easily carry a camera rather than carry around a heavy one. This camera fits inside my smallest purses. It's simple to use, takes good photos and it's a good price. I bought it in white (I have a thing for white cameras!) the back is charcoal gray though. It's stunning and you'd think white would show dirt more than the other colors, that doesn't seem to be the case here."

The other two are still in use. I bought this one because it has even greater zoom capacity, and produces very sharp images with the Leica lens. I use these cameras to do field work, and often have to shoot from some distance. They are capable of retaining a high degree of detail. I would warn that the lens protection does have a tendency to get dust in it. This can lead to jamming, with e zoom becoming inoperable. So it is important to keep the camera in a case when it is not in use. I have shot thousands of frames on these cameras, and find they do stand up to repeated use. The durability, quality of picture, the compact size, and the cost make the Panasonic Lumix DMC-SZ3 a really great tool in the arsenal of folks doing field work. Because this camera does not have a view finder it can be a challenge under certain light conditions. But even shooting blind I am usually happy with the results."

It's fairly light, quick and easy to use. I like the color too. I've owned it roughly three years. I used it yesterday as a matter of fact and still works great. When I need pics that are better than what my iPhone can provide I grab this camera. I liked it so much that I also purchased a newer waterproof version for underwater use.<br /><br />I really researched this class of camera then tried them out in a store. I chose this one because I liked the way it felt in my hand and the menus were all intuitive. I bought on Amazon because the price was right and I knew if there was a problem they would take care of it.<br /><br />I takes excellent outdoor pics by the way. I know there are better cameras out there, but I wanted something simple that does a really good jump. Once I have it set the way I wanted it I don't really mess with it. I turn it on and fire away. The plus for me is I can store it in my pocket. It's light too so I don't know it's there.<br /><br />I like to hike and do things outdoors, so this camera has seen a lot and performed quite well.

I sent it back to Panasonic and after waiting for almost two months I called to check in with the warranty and was told that they were sending the unit back since it was out of warranty. I had provided proof of purchase that I had purchased it less than a year later. They stated that since it was purchased from a third party vendor they couldn't honor the warranty. So word of warning. Careful buying from third party vendors since the clock starts on the warranty the day the vendor purchases the item, not when you purchase it and Panasonic camera's don't last more than a year.

This may seem like a minor issue, but the speed of taking multiple photos is a nice feature even when taking someone's portrait.<br /><br />The camera case is well constructed and simple in design.  A few of the features are a little tough to figure out without using the manual.  (Example:  I think it should be easy to figure out how to set the timer to take a pic, but I couldn't figure this out without reading the manual).

It is not at all complicated and has lots of different options. I try to take pictures on horseback, and can easily work with the camera while moving. On auto most of the shots were REALLY nice... beautiful shots, I have some that look professional. A few of the shots under auto were fuzzy... you have to be patient and wait a little for the camera to figure out what it needs to focus on under this option. I imagine that the camera was adjusting since I was moving when I took the shot. If you need to take a quick shot of something fast, use normal view or if you want to chose a specific photo option, your target for the photo might move by the time you flip through a couple screens to chose face, animal, candle light, etc as the specific type of photo you want. This is true of most cameras though... and like I said, it is easy to find what you need. I tried video and shots of a deer under regular and night.. with my porch light on it. I could see the deer but the camera couldn't even when I messed with different options. Some pictures under certain options showed the deer some... but not that well at all, I was disappointed with this. The camera has been durable for the month I have had it so far, and the software was easy to use as well.<br />  As far as amazon goes, they sent me an e-mail to pick up the camera at the post office as it needed to be signed for... but it showed up the next day via mail and was left in my mail box.

I have been looking for a small camera that will fit in my pocket yet take great pictures and after a lot of research I found it! I highly recommend this camera. One of my biggest pet-peeves with most cameras is the slow shutter speed. I know that to get perfectly fast shutter speed you really need to invest in a professional camera but I have to say this Panasonic has great shutter speed! I have three very active kids and I manage to get about 90-95% of the pictures that I want with this camera. I bought it right before our recent vacation to the beach and was so pleased with how it worked. Cloudy skies, bright sun, indoors, outdoors, it took great pictures in all environmental conditions. It is a breeze to use also. After charging the included battery with the included battery charger, I just started shooting. I hope to eventually read the manual to see if I am missing any info that may come in handy but for now, it works just as I need it to. My only complaint is that I cannot figure out how to zoom in/out while taking a video (after reading the manual I might find out how...but really a very minor complaint overall). One of my favorite features is what I call the 'quick zoom' button. Push the button once and the camera quickly zooms x8, push it again and it zooms to full optical zoom, push third time and it quickly goes back to no zoom. Great feature! If you are looking for a great little camera that will take great photos this is it!"

A true go anywhere camera<br />- love the intelligent auto mode.  Don't even have to tell it I want to shoot in macro mode, it figures it out and switches automatically.  Same with portraits.<br />- Very good quality images for a 16MP point and shoot even at full size magnification.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- as other have noted the battery could last longer.  It's a 600MaH battery and an extra one from Panasonic is $30-$50.  Fortunately if you search Amazon for 'Wasabi Power Battery for Panasonic NCA-YN101G ' you will find a replacement with twice the capacity for around $10.  Why buy an extra Panasonic battery when for ten bucks that one battery will last as long 2 Panasonics?  Older reviews indicate there are no 3rd party batteries that will work in this camera, but that is not true any longer.<br />- It's a 16MP camera with a tiny image sensor so at full magnification there is a lack of sharpness that is very noticeable (at full magnification of the image) when shooting in less than ideal conditions.  This isn't the fault of this camera, every point and shoot camera has a tiny image sensor and 16mp is too high for those sensors to record every pixel accurately.  In ideal, outdoor conditions and in some cases with the flash close up they look very good though.  For those who will never print at larger than 10x14 or only display at greatly reduced resolutions (such as on monitor or HD TV) this is a non issue.  Do not think reducing from 16MP to 10MP (this camera allows this) will change the lack of clarity at full magnification as it can't.  It's still the same sized image sensor, just not using all of the area.  If you want a camera for large prints, choose lower MP in point and shoot or go DSLR for it's larger image sensors.  I will note that the lack of clarity at full magnification is proportional to how far away the subject is.  For macro shots I am incredibly impressed.  Those are very clear even at full magnification.<br /><br />In between Pro and Con:<br /><br />- the 720P video mode is OK.  The sound is what you would expect, wind noise will be a problem outdoors and voices from far away will sound 'off'.  Same as any video from any camera with an internal mic.  The video quality itself seems fair.  About what I would expect from a camera with a video mode.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Nice little camera for the price.  Nothing about it is revolutionary, but nothing is awful about it either.  The intelligent auto mode is quite slick and a feature I will look for from now on with any point and shoot I consider."

It has some nice features, as do all the cameras in this class, but the quality of the photos is lacking.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I currently have a Canon SX100 IS that takes beautiful pictures, but I've been using digital cameras for over ten years and have not had another that takes bad pictures except for another Lumix that I purchased because of the zoom and good ratings.  I also did not keep that one.  One more sour taste was the $33.00 it cost to return this camera.  I am done with Panasonic."

But I am glad I made this purchase. It has so many options for the price. One great thing about this camera is that its picture quality under low light conditions is really good. Generally with other cameras if you take a picture in dark with flash on, the things close by become bright and you get an almost black background. With this camera, somehow I did not have that problem. The light was spread evenly and I was able to capture exactly what I wanted.<br />Another important factor here is the 16 MP. You will know the difference immediately. I viewed the pictures that I took recently on my 47' HD TV and even on full screen, there was not a single blur photo (of about the 1000 I took on my trip).<br />The only drawback I could find is that each picture is about 8 MB, which means you at least need to get a 8 GB memory card if not more.<br />All in all, highly recommended."

After only about a month or two of not being used, somehow dust had gotten into the lens.  After contacting various cleaners and the company itself, the only option was to send it in to the company to get cleaned.  The fees would have cost MORE THAN THE CAMERA.  Unfortunately, I had to get rid of it.  It was great while I was using it, but I'm not going to take pictures with loads of specs showing up in each picture.<br /><br />If you get this, you need to invest in some type of protective storage case."

Like other reviews, the lense stopped operating out of no where.  The camera is still under the one year warranty, however, we received an email from Panasonic with pictures showing two minute scratches to the outside of the camera.  This voided the warranty as they consider it 'abuse' of the camera.  They want more than the replacement cost of the camera to fix the lense.  I am in the process of fighting with them to fix it, however I have not at all been impressed with the camera thus far.  I find it difficult to take a consistently clear picture.  Outdoor pictures turn out very bright and indoor pictures turn out dark and yellow.  Pictures of the children are almost always blurry.  The automatic/intellegent mode rarely takes a great picture.  The camera comes with very little instructions on how to operate the different modes.  The only I really like about this camera is that the battery seems to last a long time once charged."

I have no need for anything high-end--just a basic point and shoot that will allow us to take basic family photos.  The reason I chose this camera over the similarly priced Nikon was that there were complaints about shutter speed on the Nikon.  My Canon had the same issue, where it felt like you had to wait for 5 seconds before the camera actually took the picture.<br /><br />So far, I love this camera.  I have it set on the 'auto everything' setting as I know nothing about photography, and it takes great pictures.  Shutter speed is fast, so I don't have too many cases where by the time the pictures is taken the subject has moved away (ie cat pics).  The quality of the photos is amazing--almost too good in some cases as you can even see dust specks.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a basic high-quality point and shoot camera."

I've used Canon Powershots for many years and decided to try something different.  Reviews said that this Panasonic writes to the card very fast, which was something I needed - and it definitely does.  It does pretty well in low light situations and focuses very fast as well.  The Intelligent Auto setting works in most situations.  I took it to a park and used the zoom on some wildlife and it did a decent job.  But it is very uncomfortable to hold, especially in one hand.  The metal strip along the side digs into your hand after a couple minutes - so if you use a camera as I do - for many shots, you will need to think about a more comfortable grip.  I bought an aftermarket stick on grip by Flipbac and it helps a lot."

Came home, got on our faithful Net, found this new camera with the identical physical features but with a wide-angle lense, 8 X instead of the 6X that passed, fits great in my hand and small pockets in m travel purse.

One problem all of them seem to have had is low light.  Indoors and almost always indoors without a flash is a problem, but not with this one.  Yes, the pictures are a little grainy, but not too bad and they're sharp and in focus.  The image stabalization which is advertised on many really works on this one, I took a lot of pictures on vacation at 1/8 second or longer and most came out well, and that is a long time for a handheld shot.  The 8X zoom is also very good for such a small little camera, though sharpness does suffer some as the zoom is increased.  Battery life is a little shorter than I'd like, while I never ran it out it seemed like I was almost out after only 125 shots or so, the battery icon was showing a low charge.  This isn't a perfect camera, more like very good, not excellent and 4.5 stars is what I wish I could rate it, but it has impressive zoom and excellent low light capabilities for a modest price in a small package."

I've added a couple of pictures to the gallery, one indoor and one outdoor mountain scene.<br /><br />Overall impression, good camera for the price, good features, fast. This is definitely a solid point and shoot for well lit shots, I probably could have tweaked and dialed in the settings to allow for better indoor pictures.<br /><br />I've ordered a canon ELPH 500 for about $25 more, this particular canon may not be around much longer as it has been replaced with a new model.

I got to take some of those &#34;classic&#34; Out West photos you see in the movies, etc. When I pulled it out at Antelope Canyon the guide asked for my camera, and was working the features like an expert in like 2 seconds.

No problems with any of them.  My wife has used hers the most, taken thousands of photos and she carries it in her purse to be there whenever she wants it.  You can only get a certain amount of image quality from a photo sensor the size of a small shirt button.  Amateur and professional photographers wouldn't lug around big heavy cameras and huge lenses if they could take the same photos with a camera like this.  It's a point and shoot, snapshot camera.  It's well made, reliable, easy to operate, and within the limitations of what it is, it takes great photos.  If all you do is post photos on the internet, look at them on your computer, or print an 8X10, it has all the image quality you will ever need.  That covers about 90% of camera users.  One of the big DSLR companies did a study of their customers and discovered that more than half never removed the lens from the camera, didn't own any other lenses, and didn't even know how to take the lens off the camera.  But they thought they would get better photos by spending four times the money and carrying around a big heavy camera.  Wrong.  Look at some of the iPhone pictures taken by professional photographers.<br /><br />There is a newer model now, the ZS25, that is similar but has a 20X zoom.  But it's double the price."

Good colors, good image quality for this sensor size and price range, and many nice features in a well designed camera make these true gems.  Panasonic's IA (intelligent auto) mode is pretty good, so you can just point and shoot if you like. If you wish, you can take more control. It's up to you and what you prefer.

It is the perfect size for my ...,"I bought this camera about a year ago and I still love it. It is the perfect size for my pocket to take anywhere I go and is the better option to take excellent pics with other than my cellphone. Way better than any cellphone camera that I have used. With a little familiarization with the camera and its icons you will be taking great photos in no time. The 12.1 megapixels are great if you want to blow up your photo and make a great 8x10 picture suitable for framing. The built in video camera works well too. Just be careful when zooming in during filming because the image stabilization, as with most cameras, isn't very effective when zoomed. Use a tripod and its great then. The battery life is very good with this camera but I always carry a spare in case. If I had to change anything about this camera I would like to see more zoom and improved battery life. The battery charger that come with the camera works well and I have no complaints here. Overall I would recommend this camera to a novice user as well as a more seasoned user....it works well for both and is fairly simple to figure out for the novice. It's a reasonably priced camera that combines the best options for both photos and videos and with a little practice is a great tool."

I travel and love to shoot tons of photos.  My previous, and much loved Canon 790is, camera was great but limiting due to minimal zoom, and a funky spin wheel to access options (never worked easily in a hurry).  I originally thought I'd get a DSLR...but after spending time with one a camera store...I'd have to admit that as great as they are...too heavy, bulky and just too much camera. Also felt the same way about the several 'small' sized not quite DLSR and not compact cameras. I decided that for me a camera that I could carry easily, stick in my pocket and still take great photos was most important. Did alot of research and looked at many cameras. Settled on the Lumix ZS7 due to it's great lens, 'is' in zoom mode and size. It takes great photos, does not appear to have any issues with low light situations as reviews indicate, and is easy to use (the dials for choosing modes and features are much better than the Canon spin wheel). The GPS feature is ok...remember to turn off for airplanes and to save the battery.  It is fun to have the photos 'mapped' on the ipad!  Only two complaints: 1. the wrist strap does not have a slider to secure tightly to the wrist as did the Canon...will either find a better wrist strap or use the Canon one and 2. the battery/SD slot door only closes with a sliding latch (the Canon closes without a slide latch).<br />bottom line...for a stick in the pocket fast, wide angle, 12x+zoom...a great camera.  I'd get it again."

I had ordered a canon 130is and sent it back.  This has better color particularly on indoor shots.  It has a quick menu for certain thing you want to change altho I do miss the ISO button which did not require going to a menu - had that on my canon 800is which i love for outdoor photos.

Still plyaing with it so will add sometime when get to try great scenery pics in my annual fall trip to the mountains.<br /><br />Peeves.  The happy color ( which I think is like vivid on the canon) only workd in auto which is odd since it onliy works on manual in the canon.<br /><br />it does not go back and forth between vertical and horizon on the vertical picture displays. you have to choose to have the pic diplayed with the horizontal and lose part of it in viewing or set it to only show in sideways long view so that you have to turn the camera each time.<br /><br />You will want and extra battery alth this one last for a reasonable while.<br /><br />More after I use it in more situations.

I will be short and to the point. The camera is amazing in what it can do well. The picture quality is very good with ideal lighting, the same can be said of the video. However, and it is a big however. The camera is horrible in low light situations. Using the shutter speed over 400 and in many cases 400 itself renders the picture useless. I may be doing something wrong, although I doubt it, but when I attempt to use any speed over 400 the pictures come out with a extreme amount of 'noise', many times with rainbow, streaky colors, rendering the picture un-viewable. I have a small Canon IXY camera that runs circles around this camera in low light situations.<br />  I will continue to experiment with different settings in low light situations, but I am seriously considering returning this camera due to its disappointingly low light results."

Did not quite like its color rendering and that camera itself has now stopped working (hangs after taking a couple of pics). I wasn't sure if I should buy its newer cousin but some of its features were in line with what I wanted. Turns out - Panasonic has made great strides in the intervening years. For one thing - color is vastly improved compared to earlier models.<br /><br />Now that I've used it for a while -<br /><br />1) Its truly a great shirt pocket size, wide angle, Hi Def camcorder. Dedicated HD camcorders don't come with a wide angle lens and all they let you capture at your kids b'day is the cake and two people on either side. With this camcorder - you can capture the crowd and when you play it back big screen, it looks spectacular with true colors and high resolution. With the huge resolution increase possible with HD video, you also need a wide angle lens to do it justice.<br />2) It can zoom while taking video - all the way to 12X optical and to 16X with not much perceptible loss of resolution. The zoom is silent and does not grate into your sound (I don't note it). Focus is maintained rock steady through zooming. Zooming is slow, but that can be a good thing - most people zoom too much and fast in home video's - making home video's un-watchable.<br />3) Someone mentioned two zooming speeds. Really? I see only one zooming speed. Not like a camcorder where zooming speed can be varied by pressing more or less on the zooming lever. Takes me about 10 seconds to go from 1 to 16X - so its a bit slow.<br />4) Sound is good (stereo mike and dolby digital recording). Way way better than any other camera based sound I have used so far. The mikes are on top and prone to get blocked with my fingers now and then. Wish they were in front.<br />5) There are 3 selectable bit rates - I use the highest one and later join and recompress the videos with the free DIVX converter to MKV. I don't note any stutter or jitter in my video's.<br />6) With approx 12MB left in my card, the camera can take one and half hrs of video at highest bit rates, 2 hrs at medium and 3 hrs at the lowest setting. Thats plenty long. I use a class 4 card and works fine (AVCHD compression).<br />7) Low light performance w/o zoom is also tolerable. If you also zoom in low light, too little light reaches the sensor for  decent images.  By low light - I mean a dimly lit room. With normal lighting, the video's look fine.<br />8) Image stabilization is very good. I can even walk with the camera and take watchable video's.<br />9) Face detection works when taking video's - perfectly exposed faces in a backlit environment.<br />10) The batteries don't last very long when taking video's (haven't calculated how long). The batteries are electronically locked - so not any aftermarket spare will work. However - this one works fine (I just bought it) and the battery came fully charged -<br />http://www.amazon.com/Power2000-Replacement-1200mAh-Lithium-Panasonic/dp/B002VJ1FDE/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1280437856&sr=1-5<br />11) Way way better than a Flip HD camcorder in every way. I am really puzzled why people buy Flips anymore.<br /><br />Other notes -<br />1) Shape and size are perfect. You really want a rectangular box and not some crazy rounded shape like some of the Canon's (like SD 940 - which  I own). Box is the only shape that will stand stable on its edge when you are trying to take a self timer shot. Fits fine in a shirtpocket with a cloth case on it.<br />2) Low light with zoom can make for really noisy pics (visible when you see them at 100%). (I mostly use my SLR for 'in-home' pics)<br />3) Lens is really sharp. I can note the diff with SD940 (Canon).<br />4) Color is good.<br />5) GPS is essential and works well. Only way to remember where pics were taken 10 years from now. I leave it on at all times.<br />6) Made in Japan (not China)<br />7)Does not have a standard USB port - so you need to keep the special cable handy. Its not as big a con anymore since I rarely connect a camera to a computer.<br />8) Panasonic does give you firmware updates to improve the performance of the camera after you've bought it. I just updated mine from 1.0 to 1.1.<br />9) The viewing screen is very good , antireflective coated and visible in bright sunlight.<br />10) Flash pics are much better exposed than my Canon SD940<br />11) I hope it lasts - unlike my TZ-3.<br />12) Ergonomics, button arrangement and screen information is excellent. Nice metal throught I used to not like the one press video function, but with a kid in the house, I think its the way to go. There's lots more one can write on this camera but I need to keep this review short. I'll be happy to answer  specific questions anyone might have."

While not the quality of a DSLR and without RAW option, this camera produces very acceptable images. This may sound less than complimentary but as my other cameras are DSLRs, this actually speaks pretty well of the camera. What I really appreciate about the JPGs are the saturation and the lack of flaws. The 12x zoom starts at a respectable 25mm equivalent and the image stabilization makes the extreme telephoto practical to use. The blow away special feature is the built-in GPS. I've been laboriously geo tagging images for years but with this camera it's all automatic and so much fun! Admittedly the battery drain takes a toll when GPS is on all the time but with a couple after market spare batteries it's not an issue.

In addition, the colors are not accurate, and the camera is just plain slow. i used it to shoot a party, and most of the shots were blurry.<br />No wonder so many people don't think they can take photos-so much equipment is inferior.<br />I was so excited to have a camera that I could just put in my pocket that I was willing to forego having RAW.

So I settled for the Zs7 instead. Read the reviews and thought. Well its cheaper and its the newer version of mine.  So I went ahead and ordered. Just received it today, I was super excited.  But then that disappeared as soon as I opened the box.  The exterior quality is cheaper, way cheaper than the previous model. It almost feels flimsy. The zoom tab...is plastic, the point and shoot button has a plasticy feel to it. The different modes slot, does not easy glide. The Zs3 I could change the mode with my thumb, sliding it easily. The casing of the camera is plastic, the Zs3 is actual metallic feeling to it!!! and its way lighter than the Zs3.  I liked the idea of having a heavier camera, much more sturdy. I'm returning this bad boy as soon as I get a postage stamp on it. It's unfortunate, the newer model with all the upgrades they did to the piece they neglected the exterior.

Panasonic,Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Red),20110731,B00395YABI,4,6,7,"on July 31, 2011",ANONYMOUS,Dueling pocket super zooms: DMC-ZS7 versus Fuji F300EXR,"Hummm... where to begin.  I'm a very experienced amateur photographer.  My dad and I used to develop and print our own color film & prints in our basement darkroom, back 40 years ago when essentially zero amateurs even attempted this. I even worked for a short while (and got paid) as a photographer.  (But that also was a long time ago.)  Still, I know my way around a camera.<br /><br />I've owned several different film cameras in my life, but sold off the last one a few years ago because I could see the handwriting on the wall.  My first digital was an Olympus C-5000, which was nice, but only 5mp.  It had a couple of special features that I really miss.  I'll come back to those.  After that I got myself an Olympus SP-570UZ, in part because that is the ONLY model in the Olympus SP line that actually had a hotshoe for external flash.  I'll come back to that too.<br /><br />So anyway, recently I knew that I was going to be taking two trips, one of which was a rather challenging hike in Yosemite, so I decided to get myself something really compact and light.  Lucky for me I found not one by two big-zoom pocket compacts on sale as open box items in Amazon marketplace at ridiculous low prices.  (They have probably fired the guy who listed those by now, because really I got these both dirt cheap.)<br /><br />The first one I ordered was a Fuji Finepix F300EXR... basically last year's model, open box, at a knock down price.  This is another shirt-pocket big zoom compact (15x zoom, 12mp, 3.0' LCD).  Then I saw the Lumix DMC-ZS7 (black)... also last year's model... on Amazon as a open box for an even more ridiculously low price, so I said 'what the hell' and bought that one too, intended to return one of the other, depending on which one I liked best.  (I am a big fan of buying last year's model of anything and everything.  No matter what it is, this year's model is always overpriced, because all companies know that they can gouge the 'early adopters'.)<br /><br />So I got both and ran a few trivial picture quality comparisons and for both outdoor and indoor the DMC-ZS7 was quite clearly superior in terms of picture quality.  (I *did not* actually make any 'low light' tests.  I feel obliged to mention that because the marketing materials for the Fuji assert that it gives markedly superior low-light performance.  I have not really checked this claim and thus can't say, one way or the other.)<br /><br />Both of these cameras are 12 megapixel models, but as I say, my own test shots, when displayed side-by-side on my monitor left no doubt.  Image quality was superior on the ZS7... perhaps not all that surprising of a result, given that the original MSRP at release was about a hundred bucks higher for the ZS7 versus the F300EXR.<br /><br />Size and weight of both cameras is essentially identical.  Both/either fit quite comfortably in a shirt pocket or a jeans pocket.  (Because these were my first ultra-compacts, I wasn't sure that would be true until I received them.)  Both are about the size of a pack of cigarettes, but a bit longer and only just barely thicker.  Both cameras have outer skins that are mostly metal, with some plastic trim here and there.  Both feel quite solid and build quality of both appears to my eye to be excellent.<br /><br />The F300EXR has slightly longer zoom (15x versus 12x) but given the choice, I'll take the better image quality over that extra zoom length.  Both cameras have nice 3.0 inch high-res LCDs, and both of those are sharp as a tack.  Both can take 720p high-res movies, and both have HDMI outputs.  (These were two features I really wanted.)  Both cameras come with essentially identical standard accessories, AV cable, USB cable, manual(s), software disks, and writs strap.  Both provide at least a modicum of manual controls... something else I definitely wanted... as well as shutter & aperture priority modes.<br /><br />Controls on both cameras are comfortable and, for the most part, intuitive.  The F300EXR has a kind of outer ring around the normative North/South/East/West/OK button set, and in playback and other contexts this is helpful.  The ZS7 doesn't have that, and to make matters worse the 'legend', i.e. symbols indicating the function, that are on each of the North/South/East/West buttons pn the ZS7 are simply engraved into the tiny shiny metal buttons, making them very nearly impossible to even read in dim light (or actually impossible if I don't have my reading glasses on).<br /><br />The F300EXR power switch is push-down type, whereas on the ZS7 it is a slider switch.  (I prefer the latter.) On the F300EXR, the only way to playback is to power on (causing the lens to extend and the flash to pop up) and THEN press the playback button to switch to playback mode  This is clearly wasteful of time & battery power.  The ZS7 has a more sensible slider switch which can be set to either recording or playback mode BEFORE you slide the power switch to ON.<br /><br />As has been noted elsewhere, the F300EXR flash pops up and stays up whenever the power is on, and unfortunately, it is right win the spot where you are most likely to rest your left index finger. (You DO hold your cameras with both hands, right?)  By popping up, the F300EXR's flash maybe gets a tiny bit further from the lens (thus reducing red eye?) but I doubt this 'feature' really buys you much.  The flash on the ZS7 is just there on the front of the camera.  No pop-up action.  Anyway, the pop-up flash on the F300EXR is not really annoying, just a bit surprising sometime when you power on and feel a little pushing up under your left index finger.<br /><br />On the ZS7, I noted that my left index finger sort-of naturally came to rest often on the upper left front corner of the camera.  That's not a problem until the camera wants to use the infrared thingy to help with auto-focus, at which point your'll note immediately that you need to move your left index finger slightly to get it out of the way of the infrared.<br /><br />The menu system of the F300EXR is quite good. It's clear, easy to read, dark-gray/light-gray superimposed over whatever would otherwise be displayed on the LCD at the moment.  The menu system of the ZS7, yellow-on-white, didn't seem quite as nice to me, but both/either will get the job done.  One major irritant with both of these that could easily be rectified by the manufacturers is a missing feature that I have on my Olympus SP-570UZ, i.e. built-in verbose help pages/screens within the menu system.  On the SP-570UZ, if you don't understand or are not sure about the function of some setting or another, you are just one tap away from a very helpful verbose English language description of the function of that setting.  It's almost like carrying a condensed/abridged version of the manual around with you, only better.  Why all digital cameras don't have this feature is beyond me.  It really doesn't take up much memory OR require much programming and even the simplest digital cameras nowadays are so complex and have so many features and functions that most have manuals that go on for more than 100 pages.  Are we supposed to MEMORIZE all that before sallying forth into the field to take pictures??  I think not.  So put it in the camera!  That way we can't lose it, like that bleedin' lens cap we haven't seen in the last five years.<br /><br />The super deluxe let-me-do-it-all-for-you point-and-shoot automatic-everything modes on both cameras produced generally excellent results in a variety of situations and conditions.  To my eye, auto-focus, auto-exposure, and auto white balance on both cameras pretty much always produced acceptable results, however as I've said, I am old-school, and where 'auto with aperture priority' on small cameras such as these, where you can't really get thin depth of field no matter what you do (because the lenses are just too tiny), seem like an entirely useless/superfluous setting, I did feel the need to try auto with shutter priority on both cameras for various shots, just to keep the respective 'intelligent' auto modes from mucking up the shot with excessively optimistic shutter speeds that wouldn't actually work in practice, especially handheld, towards the long ends of the zoom ranges.<br /><br />Battery life on both the F300EXR and the ZS7 was beyond excellent, and seemed to me to be well beyond what you would ever need for any one sitting OR even for an entire short vacation.  I mean who on earth takes 250+ shots in one sitting?  I'm an old-school guy who grew up on film cameras and who always had to worry about running out of film.  8GB SDHC cards are dirt cheap, so if you get one of those, then really, in the modern digital era, the only thing you ever really need to worry about running out of is battery power.  But as I say, with these cameras it seems like you don't even really need to worry about that much either.  I'm paranoid, so I bought an extra (cheaper than Panasonic) third-party spare battery for the ZS7, and now I feel like an idiot for having done so, because really, I doubt that I'll ever even use it.  I took about 100 shots on an all-day hike in Yosemite and I still had plenty of power left at the end of the day.  Today I did my 31+ minute test movie, and even that didn't move the needle on the battery charge indicator... a rather surprising result given that modern video compression is known to be rather CPU (and power) intensive.<br /><br />The two Olympus cameras I had before I bought these two shirt-pocket compacts were straightforward to get pictures and movies from, even when I was plugging them into my UNIX system.  Both cameras just acted like a USB drive, with a FAT filesystem and so forth, and both could be 'mounted' as a drive on UNIX or even,,, yecch... Windoze.  I assumed that all digital cameras behaved this way nowadays, but I was disappointed to learn that the F300EXR doesn't work this way.  Instead, it speaks some protocol called PTP.  In order to get stuff directly off the camera (from FreeBSD) I was going to have to load some additional software and diddle several system settings.  Blecch. I never did.  Instead I just bought myself a cheapie SD/SDHC card reader.  Problem solved.  On the other hand, the ZS7 _does_ behave just like a USB drive, so I could just plug it in, mount it as a drive, and start pulling stuff off.  I like that.  It's simple.<br /><br />The ZS7 has three features that definitely set it apart from the Fuji F300EXR, i.e. GPS, stereo sound recording, and the ability to record movies with some modern flavor of data compression, specifically AVCHD.  Personally, I don't give a flying fig about the GPS.  It's been set to off since I got the camera.  (I _do_ already know what city I am in, thank you very much.)  If I can ever figure out how to get actual GPS _coordinates_ out of the ZS7, and not just city names, then I will think that the GPS might have some usefulness, e.g. for the unlikely day I am lost in the forest with a satellite phone and need to tell my rescuers where I am.  But as I have so far not seen any setting on the ZS7 that would give me raw GPS hours/minutes/seconds coordinates, I still don't see the GPS feature as being at all useful, even with the GPS picture-tagging feature. I mean hey!  If I have a shot of Half Dome, I think I can remember that I took in in Yosemite.  If I'm looking at a shot I took of the Eiffel Tower... well... umm... DUH!  GPS is obviously just one of those techno bells and whistles that camera designers add just because they can, cheaply, and because the guys in the marketing departments think that it sounds techno-cool.  There are at least half a dozen OTHER features that could be added to these kinds of cameras for one tenth the cost and that would actually help people to take better pictures, but those ones don't seem to make it into the designs for some reason.  (See rant below.)<br /><br />The ability to record stereo sound is likewise rather superfluous, in my opinion.  I mean seriously, you have two microscopic microphones and they are sitting about 1/2 inch from one another.  Do we really think that the left and right are going to hear anything significantly different from the other?  If you do, then I have a bridge to sell you.<br /><br />Lastly, the modern video compression and the AVCHD recording format actually were and are things that I really cared/care about and want/wanted. I just now did a 30+ minute 720p/30 test recording on the ZS7.  (Yes, apparently the ZS7 _does not_ have the seemingly arbitrary 29 point something minute per movie time limit that some other digital cameras I've read about have.)  Anyway, my little 31+ minute ZS7 720p/30fps test recording came out to just over 3.6GB on the SDHC card.  That seems to me to be not too shabby, but as this is the first and only digital camera I've ever owned that can record HD or even SD movies, I really have nothing to compare it against.  Oops!  Wait a minute!  I almost forgot the F300EXR!<br /><br />OK so I did a 720p/24fps test recording using the F300EXR.  I just shot for about 11 minutes.  The resulting (AVI aka 'motion JPEG') file size came out to about 1.25GB.  So ummm... hummm... maybe the newer fancy schmancy compression of AVCHD ain't all that big of an advantage, filesize-wise, after all.  I mean if you ignore the fact that one camera (ZS7) was recording 30 frames per second and the other one (F300EXR) was only recording 24fps, then the file sizes divided by the length of the recordings actually seem to come out to a fairly comparable number for either camera (and/or either type of compression used), i.e somewhat over 1GB per ten minutes of 720p recording.  BUT WAIT!  We need to consider the relative quality of the recordings also. I'll discuss and compare that below.<br /><br />I should note also that for my two test movie recordings for the ZS7 and the F300EXR I had the cameras on a tripod, pointed in a fixed direction into my backyard, and there was no zooming.  Many ducks and Canada geese wandered in and out of the frame during the recording, but other than that, the subject matter was certainly highly redundant/compressible.  In short, if I had done these test recordings by just pointing the camera out of the side of a moving train, I think I could safely bet that the resulting video files would have been substantially bigger than these ones actually came out to be.<br /><br />Oh!  Did I mention that both the F300EXR and the ZS7 allow zooming during movies?  (On the ZS7 you don't hear the zooming at all on the recording, but on the F300EXR you do, but just a little.)<br /><br />As I alluded to above, both the ZS7 and the F300EXR can be connected to your big modern flat screen TV via a special HDMI cable.  Neither camera ships with one of these, but the cables can be had for a few bucks each off Amazon.  (Do I need to warn you to make sure you order the Right Kind for your specific camera?)<br /><br />The ZS7 shoots all movies resolutions, including 720p, at 30 frames per second.  The ZS7 gives a choice of recording in 'motion JPEG' (AVI?) format, AVCHD format, or AVCHD format annotated with GPS info. The F300EXR shoots 720p only a 24 frames per second and will record only in motion JPEG (AVI) format. AVCHD definitely should, in theory at least, provide better and more modern compression and thus considerably smaller movie files.  But see below.<br /><br />My short 720p test recordings on the ZS7, when played back via my LG BD370 and Samsung 42 inch 720p plasma were OK, but not what I would call stunning as regards to clarity.  Close ups of a cat in the garden who wasn't moving all that much were, ummm, acceptable, but it appears to me that when some of the branches (and leaves) of my local oak tree were in the shot, and when the leaves were moving on account of a passing breeze, or when I was panning or zooming, the complexity of the images was pushing the outer envelope of the video compression and/or the recording bit rate.  The oak leaves definitely did not appear to me to be crystal clear.  If you are not too critical, the the ZS7 will do just fine at 720p/30/ACVHD for your cat, your kids, or your family barbecue, and will definitely produce results that are likely better than any standard-def videocam, if only just.<br /><br />I, for one, have never been a believer in the advantages of 1080 over 720 HD.  Unless you routinely sit two feet away from your big flat screen with one of those 8 1/2 x 11 Fresnel sheet magnifiers, you are really never going to notice any advantage of 1080 over 720.  For me, even my local stations, when viewed in 720p on my Samsung 720p plasma are sharp as a tack. 1080 HD is mostly just a marketing thing designed to separate consumers from their excess money.<br /><br />I mention all this only because I want you to know that if you are expecting 'broadcast quality' 720p from either the ZS7 or the F300EXR you ARE going to be disappointed.  These pockatable cameras are just not going to give you the same clarity as a dedicated professional videocam costing 50 times as much.  But like I say, these cameras will still give you acceptable video of the family barbecue. (These kinds of higher-end pocket digital cameras are really the modern equivalent of the old family 8mm camera of bygone days... but actually a bit less sharp, I'm sad to report.)<br /><br />All that being said, the 720p/24fps recordings created by the F300EXR were definitely and obviously not in the same class as the 720p/30fps test recordings I did with the ZS7.  And no, I do not think that this was just a matter of the difference in the frame rate.  The test recordings from the ZS7 definitely appeared as if they had been shot with higher resolution, relative to the test recordings produced by the F300EXR.  But don't get too excited.  As I said above, neither of these cameras produces anything that could be mistaken for 'broadcast quality' 720p.  Still, in comparable 720p recordings, the ZS7 produces unambiguously and noticeably sharper and clearer results, relative to the F300EXR.  (But I would be happy to take either camera, any day, and by a country mile, over any cellphone-cam.)<br /><br />Other points on video recording...<br /><br />The F300EXR apparently has a 'feature' (aka bug) in the audio recording.  I noticed this when I did some test recording in my backyard.  Whenever the ducks and geese got really quiet and when the traffic noise from the nearby major arterial subsided, and when there were no planes overhead, in short when things got mostly quiet, the F300EXR apparently invoked some sort of demented auto level adjustment algorithm that causes the recording to go dead quiet, at least until the actual sound you are recording picks up a bit again.  On playback, these dead quiet periods were really noticeable, and seemed, well, odd.  The ZS7 has no such mis-feature.<br /><br />I really wanted the ACVHD recording feature of the ZS7 because I have both an older Panasonic Blu-Ray player (DMP-BD60) and also a medium old LG Blu-Ray player (BD370) that both claimed to be  able to play ACVHD, and I wanted to see if I could record some stuff in ACVHD format, burn it to a DVD, and then play it on one or both of these Blue-Ray players.  Well, I can now report that I _have_ been able to do exactly this.  I took two short 720p test recordings made in the ACVHD mode on the ZS7, used the software that came with the ZS7, copied the recordings to the hard drive on my Windoze7 system, and then used the software that came with the ZS7 to burn both recordings to a single DVD, and then popped that into my LG BD370, and it just worked, with even a little top-level menu that allowed me to select which of the two test recordings to play.  That's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news is that it was almost impossible to do all this because of at least a couple of really atrocious bugs in the Panasonic PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 HD software that came with the camera.  The worst of these bugs was that on Windows7, at least, critical buttons like 'next' and 'back' and 'ok' and 'abort' that appear at various points during interaction with the software *are not even readable*!!  I'm not kidding.  The titles that should appear on these buttons actually display as black characters on a black background!!  So I ended up having to look at the PDF of the camera manual, and at its screen shots of the software in operation, in order to deduce which of the several completely black buttons on the screen was actually the 'back' button, which one was the 'next' button, and so forth.  Without the camera's PDF manual and its screen shots, the PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 HD  software would have been totally un-navigable and thus totally useless, and I would not have been able to get my ACVHD recordings off the SDHC card OR subsequently burn them onto a DVD. In short, PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 HD is seriously broken.  I groped around for a long time on Panasonic's web site and eventually found a version 5.2, downloaded it and tried to install it and the install process failed with some utterly mysterious and entirely uninformative error message.  De-installing 5.1 before trying to install 5.2 made no difference.  (Panasonic needs to hire some monkeys to test their camera-external software.  Even a monkey could see that both PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 and PHOTOfunStudio 5.2 have critical flaws.)  At the time of this writing I don't even know yet whether I will be able to even reinstall the 5.1 version successfully or not.  At least I could get it to burn my ACVHD movies onto DVDs, albeit only while working around the unlabeled back/next/etc. buttons.  But I can't even get 5.2 to install!  Even stranger, Panasonic's web site talks about various 6.x versions of this same PHOTOfunStudio software, but I'll be bleeped if I can even find where they might be hiding those versions on their web server, let alone anything on the Panasonic web site that says what the differences might be between the different versions OR anything which lists which versions are compatible with which Lumix camera models.)<br /><br />(NOTE: The ONLY reason I am giving the ZS7 four rather than five stars is because of all of these unforgivable external software snafus.)<br /><br />Just a few final complaints about the Fuji F300EXR the ZS7, and probably every other pockatable digital camera currently on the market... (begin rant mode).<br /><br />Firstly, I know these things are already both tiny and packed to the rafters with internal guts, but seriously, how hard would it be for thje manufacturers to add a little optical or digital viewfinder, or alternatively, in the absence of that, to make and sell a reasonably priced thing that fits over the LCD, shades it, and provides a small lens with a diopter adjustment?  Despite the marketing hype, these LCDs are utterly useless in the presence of bright sun.  You just can't frame a shot with the sun behind you.  Just as importantly, it seems that everybody who designs these kinds of pocketable digitals is under the age of 45.  I say that because obviously, not a single one of them knows the first thing about presbyopia.  I am over 45, have presbyopia (like everybody else my age) and I can't be talking with my friends, ten feet in front of me, and then look down at the LCD on my camera, one foot in front of my face, and see it other than as a big blur, at least until I put my reading glasses back on, by which time I have missed the moment AND the shot.  This sucketh. I've seen shade thingies on sale that fit over 3 inch LCDs and have little diaopter adjustable lenses, and these would be perfect for people like me and our pocket cameras, but alas, these things are mostly sold to the DSLR crowd and thus cost and arm and a leg.  SOMEBODY should make and sell them for $19.95 (please?)  That would still yield a 10,000% profit over manufacturing cost.<br /><br />My (now ancient) Olympus C-5000 had a little optical viewfinder.  That proves that it can be done, and indeed, that technology is actually regressing in some ways.  the C-5000 had a viewfinder and that was 6+ years ago!  This new generation of pockatable cameras, unlike my C-5000 from 6 years ago, are (a) useless in bright sun and (b) semi-useless to the 99.9% of people over age 45 who need/use reading glasses.<br /><br />Another useful feature that my old C-5000 had that I seriously miss, and that I'm 100% sure would be dirt cheap to add to this current generation of pocket cameras was a tiny little infrared remote control.  2-second and 10-second delay timers just don't cut it if you want to get in the shot with all your pals AND have time to compose yourself and smile your best smile.  Also, I want to be able to set my camera on the other side of the garden and then fire it remotely from inside the house when and if I see some wildlife passing right in front of it.  Again, technology is regressing.  I had a remote control 6+ years ago.  Now I don't. :-(  Why?  They are cheap to make and the IR camera sensor already has to be there anyway, for the IR-based auto-focus assist.<br /><br />More absent features...<br /><br />It's too bad the designers of the current generation of pockatables are all boxed into the amateur 'snapshot' mindset.  I guess that we should be grateful that they at least include tripod mounts on these cameras, even if only as an afterthought.  But come on!  If you are going to build a camera with a tripod mount, then it is almost idiotic that the user can't even tell the whole 'intelligent auto' fly-by-wire almost-artificial-intelligence master brain/computer that 'Hey! We are tripod mounted now, so you, camera-brain, can automagically select slower shutter speeds and thus, correspondingly lower auto-computed ISO settings (for less noise).'  In short, there should be a 'tripod mounted' setting which will modify the settings selected by the 'intelligent auto' system. (It doesn't count as 'intelligent' if the camera doesn't know what even the stupidest human knows, i.e. that the camera is tripod mounted and thus more stable and jitter-free.)  In a similar/related vein, why can't these designers of pockatable cameras include some facility for plugging in the electronic equivalent of a good old fashioned shutter-release cable, you know, for when you are tripod mounted AND when you want to do shutter release without even touching... or jiggling... the camera?  I was able to buy a cheapie third-party 'electronic' shutter-release thingy for my semi-old SP-570UZ and it worked like a charm and was dirt cheap.  It plugs into the SP570UZ's USB connector, so no extra precious camera surface area was needed in the design of this on the camera side.  This is SOOOOOO technically trivial, and yet so useful to anybody who really cares about getting a rock-solid non-blurred shot that it is a travesty for ANY digital camera not to have support for this kind of optional external accessory.  I mean it's like buying an expensive BMW and then looking down where the cigarette lighter should be and just seeing an empty hole.  Dumb.  Really dumb.<br /><br />More stuff I wish I could have...<br /><br />Connectors:  Now that these pockatable cameras are getting big zooms and other higher-end features, how about thinking outside of the box and providing just some cheap/easy but potentially extremely useful connectors, specifically (a) a good old fashioned flash 'sync cord' socket and/or (b) a micro phone jack / TRS jack where an external stereo microphone could be plugged in?  Either of these would be technically trivial and dirt cheap to add, so how about it manufacturers?<br /><br />You manufacturers really don't have to worry about these extra features causing 'cannibalization' of your higher-end (and more expensive) DSLR or super-zoom bridge camera lines for the simple reason that the markets for these things are just plain DIFFERENT MARKETS.  Anybody planning a trip deep into the amazon rain forest and who wants the best photos he can get IS going to buy a DSLR, no matter what nice little tweaks he can get on a pocket portable.  Conversely, anybody going into the jungle and who just wants some snapshots to take home is NOT going to spring for a DSLR or an expensive bridge camera... or be willing to carry the extra weight... just so he can get an external mic jack or an electronic shutter release.  Different markets.  'nuff said.<br /><br />Here endith the lesson.<br /><br />Other than the above nits, I actually love both the F300EXR and the ZS7.  They are both stunning and phenomenal pieces of engineering.  But of the two, the ZS7 is the one I will be keeping.<br /><br />P.S. One other small nit about digital cameras generally and the ZS7 and F300EXR specifically. All the digital cameras I've ever owned, including these two news ones are all apparently too stupid to even know which way is up.  Literally.  Can't you manufacturers fix this??  iPhones seem to always know which way is up, so why can't all digital cameras?<br /><br />(Like many of the comments above, the following comments are addressed to the camera manufacturers.)<br /><br />Look, this is very simple guys.  Every JPEG file has a built-in orientation and thus, a built in 'upper left' corner.  So why is it that when I take my digital camera and orient it vertically, you know, as in 'portrait' orientation versus 'landscape' orientation, and then I take a shot and then load the JPEG onto my PeeCEE and then try and view the thing, the picture shows up on my screen lying on its side, rather than oriented properly?  This is definitely YOUR FAULT for not writing the JPEG file in way so that it will have proper (gravity based?) orientation.<br /><br />This is beyond stupid, particularly because I know for a fact that both the ZS7 and the F300EXR do in fact know which way is up, and they just aren't using that information properly.  I know they know which way is up, because in default factory settings on both, when I play back any JPEG that was shot 'portrait' (vertical) it shows on the LCD in ``proper'' orientation, i.e. holding the camera normally (horizontal orientation) and then playing back a vertical-orientation shot, these cameras re-orient the images so that they appear on the LCDs vertically, and with big wide black bands on either side.  To accomplish this, obviously both cameras must be adding some sorts of annotations to all JPEGs they produce which indicate whether the shot was taken horizontally or vertically.  So the cameras do know which was is 'up' for any given shot.  And they even save notes about that for each shot/JPEG.  Unfortunately, both cameras are too dumb to simply arrange for the JPEGs themselves to be oriented properly, based on which was is up and which way is down at the time the shot was taken.  That's dumb.  Really dumb.<br /><br />P.P.S.  Lowepro Ridge 30 cases fit either of the cameras described above perfectly.  DO NOT try to get a Ridge 20, based on the interior size specs and the exterior size specs for these cameras. First, you will have trouble finding a Ridge 20, because apparently, they don't make them anymore.  And as I learned, even if you get one, you will wish you hadn't, because they are so tight that it will be a chore getting either of these cameras in or out of the case.  Go with the Ridge 30, which is just slightly roomier, and thus perfect for either of these cameras."

We've also use the 'burst' feature to take several quick succession pictures of my son running fast.  The Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens is great.<br /><br />The things that were not important to us are software and GPS feature.

Panasonic,Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Red),20110601,B00395YABI,4,5,6,"on June 1, 2011",ANONYMOUS,"Versatile, feature-laden and capable camera","I cherished my 7 year old Canon A95 camera for its swing-out LCD screen, easy handling, image quality, manual options and standard AA battery power (I maintain a stash of low cost AA rechargeables). Then it broke down, and I replaced it with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 about 6 weeks ago.<br /><br />The ZS7 has no manual focusing, no optical viewfinder, a fixed LCD screen, and a proprietary battery. Its small size makes it more portable but harder to hold than the A95. But none of these are deal-breakers, and in every other respect, it's light years ahead of my old camera. The autofocus works beautifully and can be manipulated to some degree; the fast-reacting 'live view' LCD screen works as a highly accurate viewfinder; the LCD is bright, detailed, and 3x the size of the old one; and I bought 2 spare batteries. A compact camera is by definition a trade-off between portability and ergonomics, as human hands aren't going to get any smaller.<br /><br />The ZS7 is a type of point-and-shoot camera known as a travel zoom, which is an especially versatile category. Here are the features I found most useful:<br /><br />* Compactness: This thing can fit in a shirt pocket! It's taking some practice to make sure I hold it where my fingers won't obstruct the flash or sensors, or accidentally press any buttons. I'll figure it out. By the way, the extraordinary zoom range makes it about 1/4 inch thicker than many less capable compact cameras.<br />* Responsiveness: Quick to start up and be ready for use; easy to switch modes and make adjustments; and most important, a short shutter lag (the delay between pressing the button and capturing the image).<br />* Display quality: The 3 inch 'live view' LCD is better than most in sunlight, automatically adjusts for different ambient lighting conditions, and can be viewed from almost any angle.<br />* Lens adjustment: It zooms optically from an exceptional 25mm wide angle (great for interiors) to a 300-600mm (depending on mode) telephoto equivalent. Note - these aren't literal focal length numbers; they're equivalent to what they would be if this were a standard 35mm film camera. Most manufacturers express them this way so you can compare apples to apples.<br />* Image quality: The lens is made by Leica, a legendarily high quality and expensive name in photography. The reviews I've read, and my own experience so far, concur that the image quality is very good. It also has image stabilization to compensate for my shaky hands.<br />* Automatic mode: The ZS7 has a mode called Intelligent Automatic, which is an understatement. It does absolutely everything for you (except turn it on, zoom, press the shutter button and wind the cat) without any manual interference. It senses people, scenery, sunsets, closeups, and motion, and changes multiple settings to produce the best results. Many of the online reviews I've read say that they often got better photos on full automatic than by trying to make their own settings. That's confidence-inspiring.<br />* Image size: 12 megapixels vs. 5mp on my previous camera. However, don't let megapixels be a basis for your buying decision; these days you'd be hard pressed to find a digital camera without sufficient resolution. Actually, 5mp is enough for all but the most demanding photographers. I set the ZS7 to take 5mp photos by default; it enables the camera to respond faster and record more images, and it almost doubles the optical zoom range (a Panasonic feature). And the 12mp setting is still there as an option, especially for larger prints.<br />* Built-in GPS! It notes the name and coordinates of the place where the picture was taken, notes the nearest landmark, and adjusts the time zone if necessary. One quibble: when the GPS is turned on, the battery drains more quickly. That's understandable, if disappointing, but you can choose between three GPS modes: The On mode updates your location and drains the battery a bit even when the camera is off; the Flight or Airplane mode turns the GPS off when the camera is off, and the Off mode is completely off.<br />* There are 28 different specialized scene modes; some of the more unusual ones are Soft Skin, Transform (stretch), Self Portrait, Panorama Assist, Food, Candlelight, Hi-Speed Burst, Aerial Photo, Pin Hole, Film Grain, High Dynamic (maximizes detail) and Underwater.<br />* There are several macro modes, a face detection and recognition feature, and up to an hour of continuous video recording (on an 8GB card).<br /><br />Criticisms:<br /><br />* Reds can sometimes appear slightly orange.<br />* The ZS7 tends to produce washed out highlights in contrasty scenes, so I like to compensate by underexposing a bit to maintain highlight detail.<br />* I can't apply exposure compensation in the Intelligent Auto mode, although the setting applies globally in most other modes. So IA mode tends to overexpose.<br />* I still accidentally press the movie record button sometimes; I showed the camera to a friend, and she did it too.<br />* The camera is just a bit too thick for many compact cases. I found one, though.<br />* The USB cable for PC connection has a proprietary plug at the camera end, so it won't be convenient to replace. You can buy a separate flash card reader as an alternative.<br /><br />I've barely scratched the surface of this camera's capabilities, and I'm still discovering new ones. So far, though, I've found little to criticize and much to appreciate. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 is a great camera for anyone who wants to take all types of travel pictures and movies with built-in calendar management, GPS information, and automatic time zone adjustment. You'll also be pampered with almost foolproof automation and excellent image quality, and you can develop more sophisticated photography skills at your own pace with manual, shutter priority and aperture priority modes.<br /><br />=== Sept. 10, 2011 - Update<br /><br />Some good things about this camera came to light as I used it, and some not so good:<br /><br />+ The camera's Leica lens has incredibly low distortion and flare, even at the widest angle and aperture. It's a pleasure to use.<br />+ The ZS7 produces very little purple fringing (usually visible along the edges of objects against bright backgrounds). I've read that this is due to a special processing algorithm built into the camera.<br />+ Photos generally have very low noise (speckles in darker areas). It's a good thing because I tend to underexpose, which can exacerbate noise.<br />- Panasonic's noise reduction algorithm tends to smear or smudge individual pixels, which can look bad when enlarged a lot. You can combat this effect by turning down the noise reduction, using the highest (12mp) image size setting, and/or turning off the Intelligent Resolution feature. It's a tradeoff.<br />- Sometimes I wish I could focus manually, such as when shooting a Little League game through a chain-link fence. I also wish I could conveniently attach a polarizing filter. I also miss having a viewfinder where the image fills my field of vision.<br /><br />I'm still a big fan of this camera."

I settled on this one due to the reviews.  it is SUPER ez to use.  i have not even read the instructions yet!  it has incredible zoom and there is NO shake with this feature!<br />i am having a little issue with taking pix of myself.  but i will get that 'down'.  oh, there is something a little odd, when zooming in to view a photo already taken, the zoom has sorta 'pre set' zooms identified....i cannot get it to smoothly zoom in, it zooms to where it does (hope this makes sense).  i do like that the photos all make themselves upright to view/store. This is handy (i believe) when using those digital frames.  this way you wont have to fix each photo to the upright position for viewing as it will already be that way!<br />to download photos is totally ez.  just hook the usb to the computer.<br />i am writing this review and have not even fully checked out the camera but merely used it and shared photos.  but from that standpoint alone it is a terrific camera!"

The ZS7 is everything I had hoped it to be and more. It's small and fits nicely into shirt & pant pockets, has mostly metal quality construction and feels solid; the zoom feature is great, smooth and quiet and works in movie mode but more than anything, IT TAKES GREAT QUALITY PICTURES IN AUTO MODE and very nice 720P movies. Funny, I almost didn't purchase this camera because a lot of reviewers on this and other sites say it 'takes good pictures.' I don't know what people expect from this camera but either the word Good has to be redefined by Webster's Dictionary people or camera reviewers are the harshest on the planet. To me 'good means average, this camera takes EXCELLENT pictures in daylight/sunlight conditions and very decent pictures in low light. The colors are very natural on auto default settings. There is a scene mode for warmer colors though if you want them. Focusing is fast and accurate and stabilization is excellent. At the price point I purchased this camera at, it was a steal.  Folks, this is not a $2500.00 SLR. This is a quality built point and shoot camera that is meant to be sold for a few hundred dollars. For the money, this is an excellent performing product.<br /><br />Full manual mode is available and if you have the desire to be creative you can be but just don't blame the camera if you don't get the settings right.  I use manual mode but mostly rely on the Auto Mode. The back screen is very easy on the eyes with its high pixel count, though I suspect very bright sunshine might or could be an issue. The menus are intuitive. And, I have to admit .... I haven't read the 'how to use' guide for the camera as I just took it out of the box and started shooting! Regarding battery life: no problems with short life so far but purchased an extra battery anyway. Better safe than sorry.<br /><br />In closing, I should mention that my previous 'point & shoots' were all 'top rated for picture taking' Canons. In my eyes, there is no comparison. The ZS7 is tops in quality across the board. It's not that the Canons were bad, heck at the time I thought they were great but this 'gem' is that much better.  Highly recommended."

Overall I have mixed feelings about the camera.  I love the customizable settings and have been able to come up with a pretty good setup for my daughter, and love that each image is snapped with her name and age.  The video feature has also been extremely handy, although I did have to dig around to figure out how to save it in a format that was readable on my laptop.<br /><br />My mixed emotions stem mainly from the color of the images.  In nearly all my indoor photos where a flash is required, the image looks very red or orange.  I have since read that I may just have a faulty camera, which is unfortunate.  I thought initially it was just a quirk of this model and with a newborn, didn't have a lot of free time to research (and possibly return)!  (If anyone has any suggestions on how I may fix this problem, I would love your advice.)"

Sadly, it is considered a disposable product to them as is their reputation for a quality camera.<br /><br />I will not buy another Panasonic product given their obvious lack of pride or support for the products they sell.

I notified Panasonic when the first camera developed this problem, but, as it was out of warranty, they offered nothing more than an address to send the camera for repairs, which were almost as expensive as buying a new camera.

From the get-go the lens cover has been susceptible to even small amounts of dust.  It would stick closed or partially closed regularly, requiring assistance to open.  Not a big deal when blown out with a can of air regularly.  It did this even when always kept cased and in a plastic bag when not in use.<br /><br />The camera got wet once when in the pocket of my riding jacket in a rain storm.  Not flooded, just damp on the outside, resulting in condensation on/in the lenses.  I set it in a bag of rice for 2 weeks...no go.  Sent it off to be repaired...$180 IIRC.  Worked fine for 3-4 day trips before dying a final time-no image on the display when you try to take a picture.  Display itself works fine...must be in the image capture electronics.  Tossing it this time and replacing with a waterproof/dustproof unit.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was a great camera...good image quality, geotagging a nice feature and great zoom.

I wanted a small point & shoot for trips to places I've been before where I didn't want to carry around me DSLR.  The short of it is, this is one of the top, by most reviews. I think the ZS10 is now available, but the ZS10 actually lowered some of the features to lesser quality.<br /><br />Why this Point & Shoot? There's lots of features on this P&S, but here are the more notable features I love compared to other P&S cameras:<br /><br />1) It's one of (2) P&S which allows not only Manual Settings, but full manual based on Aperture, Shutter & Picture. Many don't offer the ability to manually alter the Shutter Speed, let alone the Aperture. To those of us who are photo nuts who want full manual control, this camera delivers.<br /><br />2) While just about all P & S cameras offer 12 or 14 megapixels, there is one small aspect they don't tell you. If you raise ISO settings (to allow more light) above 800, 99% of all P&S cameras default to only 6 megapixels. Meaning: you don't get that shot in 12 or 14 you thought you were taking.  Panasonic has put a ton of money into fixing ISO issues with P&S cams, thus when you raise the ISO settings to 800, 1200, 2400, even 3200, the shot is still in 12 Megapixel.  Only Nikon has one P&S that comes close to this.<br /><br />3) The 12x optical zoom is more than you'll ever need, but covers a great focal length<br /><br />4) Dual Stereo mics & GPS tagging. Love both features. It's nice to get full sound recording<br /><br />I've used this camera on many travels and love it.  I recently searched this camera and see the prices are, at times, higher than when it was introduced; it's in that high of a demand.  I highly recommend."

Well, it is actually over 8 months old now and I have take over 3,000 photos and over 250 videos. I love the results.<br /><br />In the past, I would carry a much bigger camera with me when I traveled, but I wanted to down size. With the state of technology today, I was able to down size, without a big sacrifice in quality of the photo! I do not make large prints of my photos, so a very slight amount of distortion of the image at max zoom, does not both me. I use the camera to take photos and videos that I assemble into travel photoshow DVDs. The photoshow DVDs capture the true flavor of our trips and let me keep my memories for a lifetime! (If you wish to see a sample of the work I do with this camera... [...])<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera to an average photographer, or to a pro, that understands that this camera will not give you the quality of an SLR, but is a spectacular value for the money!!"

These events are always held inside large gyms, lit up by several large bright lights that do an adequate job of lighting up the gym. My criteria were as follows:<br />1. 720p or greater HD video recording<br />2. Must be able to continuously record for at least 30mins<br />3. Pocket-size (I didn't want a bulky digital camcorder or DSLR)<br />4. Good still picture-taking qualities are a bonus (I didn't want a Flip video recorder)<br />5. Reasonable price, &lt;$200<br /><br />Here's how the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 satisfies my requirements:<br />1. It records 720p HD video in two formats: AVCHD and Motion JPG<br />2. The AVCHD format allows it to record 720p video indefinitely, given enough memory (on a 16GB SDHC card, the battery runs out at 1 hour 40 mins, while the card can support 2 hours of video)<br />3. It's not a slim camera that you can easily slip into your jeans, but still a compact digital that feels good in your hand and doesn't require a separate camera bag.<br />4. While it doesn't take the best pictures under low light conditions, it does quite well in all other settings. The 12x zoom is very nice.<br />5. I paid $199.99 for this when it was on sale. Above what I was looking to pay but once I saw this camera and all its features, I had to have it.<br /><br />Accessories worth buying:<br />1.

Initially, it fit the bill in everything I wanted in a pocket camera.  The only negative in the image quality is under low light conditions, where it will always use the night setting on intelligent mode and give a very grainy and low quality picture.  The biggest problem I am having with it is that it seems to have a HUGE problem with dust!! Already I have 4 dark spots in my pictures from dust and and little hair of dust that managed to get underneath the lenses.  Unfortunately, I cannot return through Amazon this late and I have a bad feeling that this will be a continuing problem with this camera.  Other than that, this was the best camera I could find in this price range but the dust problem is unacceptable.  I am contacting Panasonic and I hope they will pay for the servicing to get this taken care of.<br /><br />Update: After calling Panasonic customer support, they informed me that I will receive a different unit that is refurbished (great...) and also that I have to pay for shipping to send the camera to their facility, even though the rep. said it was a hardware problem after 2 months. Thanks Panasonic!"
